HOSTAGE TAKER:
You keep those fucking hands in the air!
Nobody move!

DISPATCH:
Code 310.
Any units respond.
We have a situation on lunar spaceship Alpha.
The Mayor of the Moon and diplomats of five neighboring worlds have been taken hostage.
Suspect is threatening the mayor with a weapon and claims to have an explosive device.
Any unit respond immediately.

HOSTAGE TAKER:
Goddamit!
Why hasn't anybody responded to my demands yet?

SPACE COP:
The only demand is that you turn yourself in, punk.

MOON MAYOR:
It's Space Cop!
Thank Gob, it's Space Cop!

SPACE COP:
It's an electro-forcefield.
It's generated by my space vest.
Comes in handy sometimes.
Like when people shoot at me.

HOSTAGE TAKER:
Oh, yeah?
Well, I bet he doesn't have a shield!

MOON MAYOR:
Oh, please don't shoot me.
I've worked so hard to become Mayor of the Moon.
My grandfather was a lowly bartender somewhere, and he'd be so proud of me!

HOSTAGE TAKER:
Shut your space hole!

COMPUTER:
Activating automatic hostage negotiation program.

SPACE COP:
Oh.
Hold on.
It's, it's loading.

COMPUTER:
Low battery.
Please recharge to continue.

SPACE COP:
Ugh.
Um...
Do you have a outlet I could use around here somewhere?

MOON MAYOR:
In the corner.

SPACE COP:
Okay.
Um...

MOON MAYOR:
No, the other...
I'm s...
The other corner.

SPACE COP:
Oh.
Well...
Um...

HOSTAGE TAKER:
Knee height.

MOON MAYOR:
Lower.
Knee height.

SPACE COP:
I see it.
I see it.
All right.

MOON MAYOR:
If you got to move it, just move it.
Just don't...
Space Cop, there is something important I must...

HOSTAGE TAKER:
You shut your face, or I'll put eight holes in it!

HOSTAGE TAKER:
Here are my demands!
I want one million in untraceable space credits, a type-six galaxy speedster fully-fueled, and a guarantee that I will not be followed until I reach the Globkin wormhole.
I can't go back to the moon mines, man.
I just can't.
I'd rather die!

MOON MAYOR:
I have no control over the conditions of the mines, you fool!
That's run by the Space Department of Corrections!

HOSTAGE TAKER:
You don't know what's it like in there!

SPACE COP:
All right.
It's done.

HOSTAGE TAKER:
Everyone's addicted to moon rocks.
You got to kill someone the first day or else they make you someone's crater boy.

COMPUTER:
Please, stay calm and listen to reason.
We will consider your demands.
If you surrender now, I promise, you will not be hurt.
Please, surrender into police custody now.

HOSTAGE TAKER:
No.

COMPUTER:
Activating tactical protocol.
Please raise your right arm.

HOSTAGE TAKER:
What's this guy's deal?

SPACE COP:
Justice is served.

MOON MAYOR:
Space Cop!
He put a bomb in the mine!
He said if his heart stopped beating, it would trigger a detonation, collapse the mine, and kill everyone inside it!

SPACE COP:
My guess is, he's bluffing.

SPACE COP:
Time's up.

MOON MAYOR:
What?

SPACE COP:
What?

MOON MAYOR:
You just killed thousands of people!

SPACE COP:
You're welcome.

MOON MAYOR:
Get back here!
Space Cop!
Space Cop!
Fuck my life!

VIDEOPHONE:
Incoming transmission on the videophone.
Incoming transmission on the videophone.
Incoming transmission on the videophone.
Incoming transmission on the videophone.
Incoming transmission on the videophone.
Incoming transmission on the...

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Space Cop?
Space Cop, can you hear me?
It's me, the Chief of the Space Police.

SPACE COP:
Yes, hello.
Can you hear me?

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Yes.
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me now?

SPACE COP:
Can you hear me now?

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Oh, man.
That never gets old.
That never gets old.

SPACE COP:
So now that we can hear each other...
Whazzup?

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Whazzup?
Whazzup?

SPACE COP:
Whazzup?

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Hooh!
Whazzup?
Oh, my goodness.
You're such a ham, Space Cop.
I'm telling you.

SPACE COP:
You like?
Is nice!

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
It's amazing how those jokes still play, even in 2058.

SPACE COP:
That's right, chief.
So, is this about that moon thing?

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Uh, yes, yes.
It is about the moon thing.
You're a loose cannon, Space Cop.
And frankly every assignment you go out on results in multiple deaths and destruction.

SPACE COP:
Thank you.

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Space Cop, your police work is fast, loose ,and it's out of control.
And for that, we're giving you a promotion!
I'm...
I thought...
I'm sorry.
I thought it would do, it would be way more...
Does the..
It's a holographic balloon.
Does it have to...
Does it deflate in real time...
Why did we program the...
Anyway.
We are promoting you, Space Cop, to Space Traffic Cop.

SPACE COP:
Less danger.
Less responsibility.
More pay.
I'm in.

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
You're too much of a liability to sent out on actual cases.
I'm sorry.
You're a wild man, okay?
Just take this new assignment in the spirit that you've just taken it.
I'm glad you did.
See it as a positive.
It is a positive.
It's, you know, nothing...
Everything happens...
I was reading a hoverbook last night.
"When God..."
"When a door closes on God..."
I'm not remembering this right.
There is something about "go through a window of opportunity".
Fly through it or crawl through it.
I'm not really sure, but...

SPACE COP:
You mean, I get rewarded for my gross incompetence?

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
That...
You know what, yes.
That's...
I wish I had put it that way earlier.
Yes, you're getting awarded for your gross incompetence.
So...
Chief of Space Police, out.

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Do...
Do I...
Do I sign out?
Because he's still...
If he see...
If I'm seeing him, does he see me?
Because he's still on the screen.

VOICE:
You have to swipe right.

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Swipe right on... 
Just on the...
Do I have to touch the screen?
I...

VOICE:
Yes, yes, yes.

CHIEF OF THE SPACE POLICE:
Swipe right on the screen.
Okay.
I'm gonna, gonna swipe right.
It will go off?
Okay.
Well, he's...
Okay, he's still right there.
You're saying he's not hearing me right now?
Does he see me right now?
Does he see me, like, moving my arms?
Because that's even weirder.
The whole thing is off?
Okay.
But does he...
But I swiped right.
Does he know that he's...
Because he's just standing there looking at...
So he's...
The guy is now standing in his living room, looking at a screen, just not talking.
How long is he gonna stand there?
Would someone come look at what I'm seeing?
Because it's creepy.
Could some...
Oh, that poor...
This is sad.
This is sad.
Someone...
We should tell him that...
Hey, if I leave, that...
I'm gonna get up from the desk, and then maybe he'll leave?
Okay.
I'm gonna get up from the desk, and then hopefully he'll go back.
Okay, I'm gonna get up.
Here we go.
Hang on.
Oh, gee.
He's still standing there.
He's totally st-...
Oh, god.
Okay.
Well, I'm going, I'm going to that thing I have to go do.
So you...
Can someone deal with this?
Can one of the tech guys come and deal with this?
He's fucking standing there.
He is fucking standing there.
Holy mother of God.

SPACE COP:
What's the rush, asshole?

SPACE COP:
Space Cop to base.
I am in pursuit of a Kabudnu class scout ship.
Registration is Charlie-Bravo-68-Whisky-Tango.

ZORBA:
Where is he?
Our window is closing.

AGNON:
He'll make it!

DISPATCH:
Copy, Space Cop.
Be advised.
Vehicle has numerous warrants and violations.
Proceed with caution.

SPACE COP:
Warrants, eh?
Violations, eh?
Caution, eh?
Well, I don't think so.

ZORBA:
We don't have much time.
We'll have to jump without him.

ALIEN OFFICER:
I have an incoming ship.
It's Grig!
He's being pursued by the space cops!

AGNON:
Space cops.

ALIEN OFFICER:
We're under attack!

ZORBA:
Open the landing bay.
Hurry!

AGNON:
Hold on!

SPACE COP:
Oh, boy.

DISPATCH:
Any units, please respond.
Code 415.
Domestic dispute.
2316 Woodland Road.
Perp is armed and considered dangerous.

SPACE COP:
Ehh...

CHARLIE'S WIFE:
Put it down, Charlie!
You're drunk!

CHARLIE:
I'm not drunk!
You're drunk!

POLICE NEGOTIATOR:
I'm authorized to listen to your demands.

CHARLIE:
All right.
Here are my demands.
I, I want $50,000 in unmarked bills.
In a suitcase.
Like, like you see them in them CSI shows.
And I want a fast car.
Like a Lamborghini or something.
And open access to the highway.
I'm going to Mexico.
Actually, make it, uh, 50,000 pesos.

SPACE COP:
Here's my list of demands, punk.
One.
Turn yourself in.

CHARLIE:
No.

SPACE COP:
Okay.
Suspect says "no".
Oh, right.
I'm trapped 50 years in the goddamn past.
Um...
Everybody is now safe.

CHIEF:
Space Cop!

SPACE COP:
Chief.
I'm right here.
Is this about that hostage thing?

CHIEF:
"About that hostage thing"?
Yes, it's about that!
You allowed a baby to be boiled alive!
You killed the perp and his wife!
You killed everyone in the house!
Things couldn't have gone worse!

SPACE COP:
Hey.
I didn't kill that baby.
The hot water did.

CHIEF:
Space Cop, you on thin ice with this department.
Ever since you came back from the future seven years ago, we've taken you in as one of our own.
But each year, you got lazier and sloppier.

SPACE COP:
Can I go now, Chief?
It's possible there's a crime happening in the refrigerator that I should go investigate.

CHIEF:
Fine!
Get out of my face!
And the next report I get like this, I'm putting you on...report!

SPACE COP:
I got a report for you.
C-minus.

CHIEF:
Feels like somebody stuck a big club up my ass.
And it hurts.

PARTNER:
Tough day, huh, Skip Skop?

SPACE COP:
Yeah, whatever.
I told you, my name is Space Cop.

PARTNER:
Well, if it means anything.
All of us here still believe in you.
That time that you blew up the drug factory with your space gun.
That was really great!

SPACE COP:
That wasn't a drug factory.
It was a convalescence home.
I wrote that off as a drug factory because it had a door.

PARTNER:
I have to go now.

SPACE COP:
Chips in a bag.
I'll never get used to that.

PARTNER:
That's okay, but don't use crayon next time.
Okay, Officer Cunningham?
Oh!
There's a 316 in progress, Skip Skop.

SPACE COP:
What's a 316?

PARTNER:
A break-in in Genesis Biotach Lab.
Someone tripped the silent alarm.

SPACE COP:
Genesis Biotech?
Isn't that the place where they keep all the cryogenically-frozen people?

PARTNER:
You bet, Skip Skop.

SPACE COP:
Well, I hope they have insurance.
Blow-up-everything insurance.

SPACE COP:
Dispatch, this is Space Cop.
We're the first on the scene.
I'm going in.

DISPATCH:
Negative, Space Cop.
Wait for backup.
Repeat, wait for back...

SPACE COP:
Whatever.
I bet you five bucks this is just another false alarm.

PARTNER:
Oh.
You're on, Skip Skop.

ZORBA:
I cannot believe that our cryptonogram is having difficulty with this simple locking mechanism.

GRIGG:
Uh, look.
I'm doing the best I can, okay?
Human computers are so primitive that ours are having difficulty reading its system.

AGNON:
You better hurry.
The authorities are there now.
You must have tripped a silent alarm.
This mission has been one failure after another.
First the wrong year.
Now this.

GRIGG:
At least it didn't take me eight years to find him.

AGNON:
We weren't even looking for him, you fool.
We thought he was dead.

GRIGG:
Ugh.
Look.
We're busy right now.

SPACE COP:
The party is over, kids.
The clown has arrived.

PARTNER:
Aughhh!
My fucking arm!

SPACE COP:
Ugh.

ZORBA:
We've run out of time.
Forget the lock.
Get the tank off whatever way you can.

GRIGG:
But we're gonna damage the...

ZORBA:
Just do it.

SPACE COP:
Partner.
You're gonna be all right.
Just hang in there.

PARTNER:
Oh, I know.
I'm only slightly injured.
I just don't feel like getting up.

SPACE COP:
I understand.
You bastards slightly injured my partner.
Now it's personal.
Aughhh!

DEFROSTED CANCER VICTIM:
Oh, my!
I'm alive!
Did they find a cure for my pancreatic cancer?

SPACE COP:
No.
Not until 2025.

DEFROSTED CANCER VICTIM:
What?
Ow!
My pancreatic cancer!

SPACE COP:
Pffft.

DEFROSTED BUSINESSMAN:
Ah!
The future!
Now to see how my stock in Enron is doing.
A black president?

COOPER:
Ahh...
Ooh...
What?
What's going on?
Oh!
Excuse me, mister?

SPACE COP:
Get out of my way!
I've got a clear shot!

COOPER:
What?
No, no.
I'm not moving until you tell me where and when I am.

GRIGG:
He's distracted.
Let's go.

ZORBA:
No.
It's not safe yet.

SPACE COP:
I don't have time for this!
I've got people to shoot!

COOPER:
Sir, I asked you a question.

SPACE COP:
Let go of my gun!

GRIGG:
I got a clear shot on that nitrogen tank.

ZORBA:
Take it.

COOPER:
Are you some kind of a cop?

SPACE COP:
Ugh.
Dammit.
Lost 'em.

COOPER:
Lost who?
What in the hell is going on?

SPACE COP:
I'll tell you what's going on.
You just interfered with a police situation...
Investigation...
Whatever.

COOPER:
Are you trying to tell me that you're a cop?
You look more like the mailman.
Or an ice cream truck driver who ate himself out of business.

SPACE COP:
You're damn right, I'm a cop.
I'm a goddamn space cop.
I'm from the future.
The future of space.
And you just ruined my night.

AGNON:
Where is Grigg?

ZORBA:
He hasn't reported back.
And he won't respond on his communicator.
We never should have brought him on this mission.
He's a liability.

ALIEN OFFICER 1:
Officer Agnon!
Officer Zorba!
It's almost ready.

ZORBA:
Excellent.
So, will he be able to hear us?
He is just a brain.

ALIEN OFFICER 2:
Okay.
So, we are sending electrical impulses to his auditory cortex.

ZORBA:
So, is that a "yes"?
Hello?
Hello?

ALIEN OFFICER 2:
Oh.
Oh, I, I'm sorry.
I'm deaf.

ZORBA:
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean anything by it.

ALIEN OFFICER 2:
Please, please don't apologize.
I'm comfortable with my disability.
I'm just here to work.
I just want to be treated the same as everyone else.

ZORBA:
That's fine.
You're doing a perfectly average job.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Hello?

ZORBA:
Dr. Schumann.
Welcome back.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Am I alive?

AGNON:
Yes.
Sort of.
Your brain has been preserved.
We're communicating with you directly through a machine.

DR. SCHUMANN:
I can't believe that asshole shot me!

ZORBA:
Yes, doctor.
Your assassination was tragic.
We tried to stop it, but unforeseen circumstances prevented us from being there in time.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Where am I?

AGNON:
You're in a scientific laboratory.
We wish to help you continue your work.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Excellent.
But my work is most intricate.
I will need a new body to continue.

AGNON:
We will do whatever we can to accommodate you.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Excellent.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.
Heh.

ALIEN OFFICER:
You guys, I'm so sorry about this.
He glitches out every once in a while.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Have it ready soon.

ALIEN OFFICER:
There we go.

CHIEF:
Space Cop, you're reckless, you have no regard for the law, or people's rights.
In fact, you're the only cop I know that's allowed people to get killed after they already dead.

SPACE COP:
Maybe you could kick me off the force.
That way I can collect unemployment and stay home watching TV all day.
I miss my stories.

CHIEF:
Hell, no.
We need you around here.
I got stock in the company that sells us insurance.
I'm gonna retire ten years early because of you.
But nevermind that.
Space Cop, I like you to meet your new partner.

SPACE COP:
Ugh.
Him?
The stiff from the past?

CHIEF:
Cop from the past, meet cop from the future.

SPACE COP:
You're a cop?

COOPER:
A detective, actually.

CHIEF:
Detective Cooper here served the Milwaukee Police Department for fifteen years.
He solved some of the biggest crimes of his day.

SPACE COP:
Yeah, like who stole the cookies from the cookie jar?
I could solve that case.
It was me.
Cookies, yeah.

CHIEF:
Space Cop, in your police work, you tend to rely on blowing things up.
And then blowing things up.

SPACE COP:
Thank you.

CHIEF:
Well, detective Cooper here can show you a few things on good old-fashioned police work.

COOPER:
He's right.

CHIEF:
That's why I'm partnering you two up.

SPACE COP:
Ugh.

CHIEF:
Meet me in the briefing room in fifteen minutes.
Now get out of my sight.

SPACE COP:
Ugh.
Jesus Christ.

CHIEF:
I need a Tums.

CHIEF:
Robinson and Cunningham, you two will take Brady Street.
And finally, after Space Cop's 13th partner's retired from the force from a minor gunshot wound, Space Cop's new partner will be detective Ted Cooper.

OFFICER CUNNINGHAM:
Oh!
Bad luck.
Sorry, man.

OFFICER #1
God have mercy on your soul.

OFFICER #2
Sorry about that.

SPACE COP:
Ehh.

CHIEF:
Now I'm assigning these two the case of the golddigger.

SPACE COP:
Oh, can't we just quit on that one?
That case is fucking impossible.

COOPER:
Tell me about this case, Chief.
I'd like to give it the old college try.

SPACE COP.
Ugh.

CHIEF:
Over the past seven years or so, there's been a lot of home invasions retail thefts of gold.
Just gold.
No jewelry, electronics, or cash were ever taken.
Now, in one instance, a large gold bracelet was stolen right out of a locked museum case with an alarm system.

OFFICE CUNNINGHAM:
Vanished without a trace.
Right into thin air.
Like an alien from the future had some sort of sophisticated short-range teleporter beam or something.

COOPER:
Nonsense.
That couldn't possibly by true in any way.

CHIEF:
Our prime suspect is a man by the name of Grigg McCool.
Now, he's been spotted on almost every security camera and identified by numerous witnesses.
The problem is, our search warrants haven't turned up anything at his residence.
He's totally clean.

COOPER:
Hmm.
Sounds great, Chief.
If there's one thing I love, it's a good old-fashioned mystery.

CHIEF:
What the hell are you doing?
You can't smoke in here!

COOPER:
You're joking.
Of course I can smoke in here.
It's a police station.
Nonsense.
So you're as funny as Officer Cunningham, chief.
Is this for real?
Are you serious?
I can't fucking smoke in a police station?
Is this real life?

COOPER:
Sure is good to be back at work, Space Cop.

SPACE COP:
Hey.
You never said why you were frozen.
Was is nut cancer?
You can tell me.

COOPER:
Well, no, actually.
I had what they call a stage-four malignant brain tumor.
It's a good thing there's a cure for that now.
In fact, I'm planning to stop by the old doctor's office later today.

SPACE COP:
Uh-huh.

COOPER:
This future is pretty great though, Space Cop.
You know, I've been doing some research, and there's amazing things to come.
Things like Commodore 64 computers with one megabyte of hard disk space.

SPACE COP:
What?

COOPER:
Huh.
Oh, you'll see, old silly Rubrik's cube for brains.
Computers!
They're gonna revolutionize the world.
In fact, some day we'll be able to send a photograph from one computer to another through the telephone lines.
It'll take several hours for the photograph to appear, but it'll be a lot faster than taking your old negatives down to the film lab.

SPACE COP:
You do know it's 2015, right?
Computers have been around for 40 fucking years.

COOPER:
You mean it's not 1972?
Huh.
The old boys at the precinct must have played a fucking prank on me, Space Cop.
You sure like eating those things, Space Cop.
Do you even know what hot dogs are made of?

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
Processed horse penis and Chinese people.
At least they are in the future.
That's where I'm from.

COOPER:
Hmm.

SPACE COP:
Do you know what I miss most about the future?

COOPER:
What's that?

SPACE COP:
Hot dogs.

COOPER:
Jesus Christ.
Hot damn!
There's our perp now.
Right on time.
Why, right here, this is another piece of amazing futuristic technology.
The boys at the precinct say this baby is state of the art.
I look through the magnetron here and I can see the pictures!
And right now I'm filming man.
He's walking around the street corners.
And right now I'm filming you, Space Cop.
Say "hi".
Say "hi" to the kids back home.
You're on television, Space Cop.
You wanna be in my rap video?
I'm filming the man now.

SPACE COP
Oh, my god.

COOPER:
I'm filming the space cop now.
Now I'm filming the man now.

SPACE COP:
I'll rack.
You got any quarters?

COOPER:
We're not here to play pool, Space Cop.
Plus, there's no pool table.

SPACE COP:
Ehh, whatever.
It's a bar.

COOPER:
Do you know what's happening?
Asshole.
Good afternoon, bartender.
I've heard about a new drink that's all the rage these days.
It's called Zima.
It's a clear beverage with 1% alcohol.
Do you have it on tap?
Jesus.
Everyone thinks I'm a weirdo.

SPACE COP:
Deal me in.

SOLITAIRE MAN:
This is solitaire.

SPACE COP:
Deal me in.

SOLITAIRE MAN:
There's no one there.

COOPER:
Oh, fuck it.
I'll just have a beer.

BARTENDER:
What kind of beer would you like?
We have 58 of them on tap.

COOPER:
You have more than one kind of beer?

BARTENDER:
Yep.

COOPER:
Why, in my day, we had one beer.
And it was called beer.
And it came in a white can with black lettering on it.
It was distributed and brewed by the US military.

BARTENDER:
We have imports, domestics, and a lot of new microbrews.

COOPER:
Now, why would a grown man want a tiny beer?
The future.
It's so weird.
Thanks.

BARTENDER:
Drink it.

COOPER:
Ooh!
Ooh!
That's delicious.
Hell of a day, isn't it?

GRIGG:
Sure.
Only six more hours of this sun cycle, then it's dark time.
Which is when I'm more comfortable.
All these UV rays give me radiation sickness.
Makes me vomit up plorga bile.

COOPER:
I hear you, pal.
I've got the same problems.

GRIGG:
Hey, nice watch.

COOPER:
Oh, why thank you.
My wife got this for me on our 10-year anniversary.
24 karat gold.
I know 50 years is supposed to be your golden anniversary, but she just couldn't wait.
My wife's long dead now.

GRIGG:
Out of range.

COOPER:
But I still got the watch.
Something wrong with the seat you were in, pally?

GRIGG:
Oh, no.
I just wanted to get closer to watch the game.

COOPER:
But, but the game's not even on.
Hey!
What the fuck?
That little boy in the fake beard just stole my watch!

SPACE COP:
You can, you can move that six over.

COOPER:
Come on, you louse!
It's time for a good old-fashioned police foot chase!

SPACE COP:
We'll finish our game later, Joe.

SPACE COP:
Activate tactical tracking program.
All right.
Let's see what some future technology can do.
Computer, locate most efficient route to the suspect.
Looks like my stocks are down.
Or maybe they're not up yet.
An ad?
Ooh.
Oscar Mayer has the new four pounder out.
Computer, see ad details.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Porn.
Porn ads.
I've...
Oh, shit.
I think I downloaded a virus.
Computer.
Computer.
Delete, delete virus.
Initiate anti-viral software.
"Ten celebrities that have secret deformities."
Oh, yeah.
Click on that shit.
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!
I've downloaded a super-virus!
I can't...
Computer...
I can't, I can't see where I'm going.
Oh, my god!
The garbage cans!
God!
Ow!
Computer.
Computer.
Shut, shut down...
Ican't see where I'm going.
Shut down these ads.
Ow!
Ow!
I can't...
Ow, my god.
Ow!
Fuck my balls!
Oh!
Computer, no.
I don't need...
That's too much information.
Turn that off.
I don't...
Computer.
Shut, shut down...
I can't see where I'm going.
Shut down these ads.
Oh, my god.
They're going through this fucking vest.
Why did I ever drop out of culinary school?
Ow!
Oh, god!
Oh, god!
The branches!
The branches!
Ow!
They hurt!
Oh, god!
Ugh...

COOPER:
You're under arrest, punk!
Oh, fuck!
Look out, Space Cop!
He's got a gun!
Oh, no!

SPACE COP:
Once again, tortoise beats the hare.

COOPER:
You didn't kill him, did you, Space Cop?

SPACE COP:
Ehh, he'll be fine.
I accidentally set my gun to stun.

GRIGG:
Why did you light that stick on fire?

COOPER:
What do you mean?
So I can inhale the flavorful smoke into my lungs.
Mmm!
Refreshment!

GRIGG:
What are lungs?

COOPER:
All right.
Now I know you're fucking around with me.
Look, I know it was you who stole my watch from the bar.
You're good.
You're very good.
Maybe the best I've ever seen.

GRIGG:
I don't know what you're talking about.

COOPER:
Look, jerky.
We caught you on film at numerous locations stealing gold.
Doesn't take a genius to connect the dots and figure out that you're the infamous golddigger we've been looking for.

GRIGG:
What proof do you have, copper?
Oh!

COOPER:
There's your proof, Johnny Broken-nose.
What are you doing with all this gold?
Who are you selling it to?
What's your endgame?
Where are you washing your money?

GRIGG:
What in the fuck are you doing?
You can't hit a suspect.

COOPER:
What do you mean, I can't hit a suspect?
Space Cop, he says I can't hit a suspect.

SPACE COP:
Of course you can.
I just saw you do it.

COOPER:
Ugh.
You can't smoke in a police station.
You can't beat a suspect.
You can't forcibly make love to a woman against her own will.
Geez.
This country really has gone down the tubes in the last 60 years, Space Cop.

SPACE COP:
All right.
We ain't got nothing.
So what do we do now, Mr. Hotshot Detective?

COOPER:
Well, if this suspect likes gold so much...

SPACE COP:
Now we have lunch?

COOPER:
No.
Then we give him some!

SPACE COP:
We give him some lunch?

COOPER:
No.
Gold.
I'm suggesting that we set a trap for him.

SPACE COP:
A lunch trap.

COOPER:
No, Space Cop.
Nothing to do with lunch.
Nothing at all.
You just ate four minutes ago.

SPACE COP:
I'm hungry.

COOPER:
Look.
I've got a plan.

SPACE COP:
Let's roll!

COOPER:
Excuse us, officers.

SPACE COP:
Coming through.
It's an emergency.

COOPER:
Oh, no!
Officer Cunningham is on the phone.
We'll get to him in about six minutes.

SPACE COP:
Just keep going.
We're in a hurry.

COOPER:
He'll have to call you back, sir.
Was that a 911 call?

TALK SHOW HOST:
Good morning, Milwaukee.
And welcome back to the show.
It's five minutes after the hour.
We have a special guest live in studio with us right now.
We teased him at the top of the show.
He has taken Europe's rap scene by storm.
And tonight he is performing live right here in Milwaukee.
Let's give a warm welcome to Diggity D.

DIGITTY D:
Yo, yo, yo.
Thanks for having me, ho.

TALK SHOW HOST:
Oh.
Nice to finally meet you, Diggity D.
You are performing at the Bradley Center tonight.
I might add that show is sold out.
How is it that you are virtually unknown in the United States, and yet you can sell out such a huge arena?

DIGGITY D:
Yeah, well, you know, I work really hard on my raps and my rhymes.
But what I really love is spending all of my hard-earned rap dollars on solid gold shit, motherfucker.
Solid gold-plated gold leaf jackets.
Gold pants.
I got gold coming out of my asshole, yo.
I love gold.

TALK SHOW HOST:
So tell me, how has your stay been in Milwaukee?

DIGGITY D:
Why, I tell you.
My hotel, the historic Pfister Hotel...
Well, it's just beautiful.
And my view of the city from the 18th floor, room number 1805...
Well, it's just magnificent.

TALK SHOW HOST:
Well, congratulations on your success.
The album which is out now is called Leaving My Hotel Room Unlocked.
And after the break, Diggity is gonna perform live for us right here in our studio with his number one single More Gold, Less Problems.
Stay with us.

DIGGITY D:
What?
You mean, I gotta perform?

TALK SHOW HOST:
Yes.
Live.

DIGGITY D:
Uh, I have to go now.

TALK SHOW HOST:
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What the...
What the...
What is that...
What's on your arm?
What?

SPACE COP:
Hey, Cooper.
Did he take it?

COOPER:
You bet he did.
And I got it all on film, too.
I took plenty of pictures.

SPACE COP:
Good.
I can't believe he took all of it.
Especially considering how heavy it was.

COOPER:
Not to mention big.
That one was almost twelve inches long.
But he put it all the way in.
He took it like a champ.

SPACE COP:
We were waiting so long, too.
I didn't think he was ever gonna come.

COOPER:
I was getting so tired of being in the closet.
But then when he finally came, I could come out of the closet.
It was so hot.

SPACE COP:
I thought I was gonna have to shave forever.
It's a good thing his sack was so large.
I wouldn't wanna wait for him to come again.
Fuck, yeah.

COOPER:
Look, just keep your eyes on him.
I don't wanna lose him.

SPACE COP:
Yeah.

COOPER:
Oh!
There he is!
I see him!
I see him.
He just swiped something by the door, which opened it.

SPACE COP:
Computer.
Hover and activate target lock-on.

COOPER:
No, no, Space Cop.
No.
Shut it down.

SPACE COP:
What?
We saw where he went.
Now we level the building.
That's police work.

COOPER:
No, Space Cop.
This is just a piece to a larger puzzle.
Who is this street punk?
And what does he have to do with this large company?
Is he involved in organized crime?
Drugs?

SPACE COP:
Wanna go to the titty bar?
Candy's working.

COOPER:
Space Cop, I get the impression you don't care for your job very much.

SPACE COP:
Why should I?
I'm stuck here in this Stone Age.

COOPER:
I'm stuck here too, Space Cop, but at least I'm making the best of it.
My whole family is probably dead by now.
And my wife, too.

SPACE COP:
How do you know?
Did you look her up?

COOPER:
Oh god, no.
If my wife still is alive, she's probably an elderly person.
Eww!
She probably can't even cook or clean anymore.
What good would she be?

SPACE COP:
I just know I'd be miserable in any time period.
In the future, my wife's dead.
In the past, she's not even born yet.
This is the only picture I have of her.
This is my most treasured possession.

COOPER:
Jesus, Space Cop.
I'm really sorry.
Do you mind if I ask how your wife died?

SPACE COP:
She was murdered.

COOPER:
Oh.

SPACE COP:
I'll never forget that bastard's face.
He had a scar from here to here.
I tried to catch him, but my shoes were untied.
I fell down three flights of stairs.
It took over 20 minutes.
Halfway down, I caught my head in the banister.
By the time I finally got to the bottom, I stepped on a rake.
It hit me right in the groin.
Made a sound like two champagne bottles popping open.
Those were my nuts.

COOPER:
Wow.
Tell me, Space Cop.
Did they ever find this bastard?

SPACE COP:
Eventually.
He died in a shootout with the space cops.
I only wish I was the one who pulled the triger.
I also wish he didn't kill my wife.
If only there was something I could do to prevent that from happening...

COOPER:
Well...

SPACE COP:
In the future, when it hasn't happened yet.
If only.

COOPER:
If only.
If only, Space Cop.
Do you know why he would have killed your wife?

SPACE COP:
He said it was revenge.
Revenge for what, I'll never know.
Some past arrest, maybe?
Could be anything.
I miss her.
God, I miss her so much.
So how about that titty bar?

COOPER:
No.
I think I'll pass, Space Cop.
I'd like to turn in.
It's been a long day.

SPACE COP:
Yeah, I guess I'm a little bit tired myself.
I should go home and watch my stories.
Car.
Activate auto drive.

COOPER:
Is this safe?
Does it even know where it's supposed to go?
Help!
Somebody help!

COOPER:
How about you take the lead on this one, Space Cop?

SPACE COP:
Don't worry.
I got this.
I'm a space cop.

RECEPTIONIST:
May I help you?

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
Who's in charge here?

RECEPTIONIST:
Excuse me?

SPACE COP:
I said "who's in charge here?"
What's the matter, lady?
Hearing problems?

RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Ahn is the owner.
So I suppose that makes him in charge.

SPACE COP:
Good.
We'd like to talk to Mr. Ahn.

RECEPTIONIST:
Do you have an appointment?

SPACE COP:
What part of "we're cops" don't you understand?

RECEPTIONIST:
You didn't say anything about being police.
I need to see some ID.
You can't smoke here.

COOPER:
What?
Where the hell can I smoke?
Gee.
Some future this is, Space Cop.
A man can't even smoke in an office building.
And Pluto isn't even a planet anymore!

RECEPTIONIST:
Mr. Ahn.
I have two police officers who are wishing to speak with you.

AGNON:
Yes.
Tell them I'll be right up to talk to them.

GRIGG:
What's up?
You wanted to see me?

AGNON:
Yes.
I was wrong about us having enough gold for the cortex.
These, of course, are fake.
This is just spray-painted metal.

GRIGG:
I knew there was something odd about that overweight European rap star who looks suspiciously like Space Cop.

AGNON:
And we're still just short a small amount, according to what we know about Dr. Schumann's plan.

GRIGG:
24-karat gold is hard to obtain without a more powerful long-range transporter.

AGNON:
Yes.
And we may be running out of time.

GRIGG:
Out of time?

AGNON:
Gentlemen.
What can I help you with?

COOPER:
Ah.
Well, I'll have a scotch on the rocks, and my partner here will have a beer.

AGNON:
I am not a waiter.

COOPER:
What?

AGNON:
My name is Agnon Ahn.
I am the CEO of this company.

COOPER:
What?

AGNON:
I am going to sit down now.

SPACE COP:
You ought to forgive my partner here.
He's from 1940-something.
They were all like that back then.
Not me, though.
I'm from a more enlightened age.
The space age.
From the future.
The future of space.
Outer space.

COOPER:
Um...
Let me introduce myself.
My name is detective Ted Cooper.
And this, uh, gentleman here is my partner.

SPACE COP:
Cop.
Space Cop.

COOPER:
Why don't you tell him your real name?
John?
Greg?
Walter?
What is your real name?
Your real name isn't Space Cop, is it?

SPACE COP:
My real name is Space Cop.
All space cops are forced to legally change their name to Space Cop upon joining the Space Cop Police Force.
It's to protect our anonymity from space criminals.
And to keep them from killing our families like my wife.
But a criminal did kill my wife.
So I guess changing my name to Space Cop didn't do me much good.
I should have kept my original name.
Holden.
Holden Madickie.

COOPER:
He is really a cop.

AGNON:
Why don't you tell me why you came here today?

COOPER:
Well, Mr. Ahn
Ahn.
That's a chink name, isn't it?

AGNON:
It's Korean, yes.

COOPER:
Korean?
What?
You don't look Korean to me, sir.

AGNON:
Oh, really?
What do I look like to you, detective Cooper?

COOPER:
Well, to me you look like an alien.
Yes, that's right.
I said it.
An alien.
An illegal alien.
You know, from, like, Brazil or the West Indies or something.
Do you have your papers?

AGNON:
Yes, I do.
My adopter father was Korean, which is why I have the name "Ahn." Now, how can I help you?

COOPER:
What do you exactly do you do here at Alian Metal Alloys Company?

AGNON:
We manufacture metal alloys.

COOPER:
What kind of alloys?

AGNON:
Metal ones.
It's complicated.
We're a small operation, but we have some rather important clients.
Been in business since 2007.

SPACE COP:
Hey.
That's the same year I came here from the future.
The future of space.

AGNON:
I have a feeling you didn't come here to discuss our business.

SPACE COP:
No.
Do you mind if I have some of this candy?

AGNON:
Yes.

SPACE COP:
Ehh, whatever.
I'm a cop.
Who gives a fuck?
I'll do what I want.
I'm taking this home with me.

COOPER:
You're right, Mr. Ahn.
We did not come here to talk about your business.
We came here to inform you of something.
Last night, we tracked a suspected criminal to your office complex.
He had key access and entered in the middle of the night.
Very suspicious, if you ask me.
Now it's out theory that he's using your building to stock illegally-obtained gold, which is a crime.

AGNON:
He's not familiar to me.
And he's certainly not an employee of this company.
I'll have the codes on all the doors changed.
I'm shocked of the breach of security, and I thank you for bringing it to my attention.

COOPER:
Well, we bring things to people's attention.
We also ask tough questions, because we're cops and that's what we do.
What we don't do is eat tons of M&Ms and embarrass ourselves in public.

AGNON:
Well, if you gentlemen didn't have anymore questions...

COOPER:
Thank you for your time.

SPACE COP:
So I noticed that your, uh, company invented chromotanium alloy.

AGNON:
Ah, yes.
A great alloy.
Very strong.

SPACE COP:
Indeed.
Excuse me.
Candy gives me gas.
Horrible gas.
Gas that smells nothing like candy.
Probably because of poop.

COOPER:
Sorry.

SPACE COP:
I'm confiscating these.
They're M&M evidence.

AGNON:
It's okay.
We have more.
It's Agnon.
We have a problem.

COOPER:
So, Space Cop.
You mentioned some kind of metal alloy to Mr. Ahn.
What was that all about?

SPACE COP:
It's called chromotanium.
It's an alloy used in the construction of space cop vehicles.
It's higly resistant to gravitational forces.

COOPER:
Hmm.
Is that so?
Why is that so interesting to you?

SPACE COP:
Because it's not supposed to be invented for another 25 years.

ZORBA:
I work here.

COOPER:
Does this mean that the Alian company is somehow stealing technology from the future?

SPACE COP:
I don't know what it means.
But I know it means something.

COOPER:
Well, we've got to get back there right away.
I've got some questions for Mr. Ahn.
This plot has just thickened.

SPACE COP:
That's not the only thing that thickened.

COOPER:
Stay focused, Coleco-vision.
We've got a job to do.
I've got a bad feeling about this.

EMCEE:
All right everyone, that was Candy.
She's both a trick and a treat, if you know what I mean.
Candy's gonna move on to the second stage.
And let's welcome...some chick I've never seen before to the main stage.
Who..
Who is that?
I, I don't know.
She's a brand new dancer.
Whatever.

COOPER:
What the hell is she doing?
Geez, the last time I've seen a dame dance like that, she had the palsy.

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
It's hot, isn't it?

COOPER:
No.

SPACE COP:
I like a girl with a little bit of brain damage.
It means that there's a slight chance she'll wanna have sexual intercourse with me.
I think she's new here, though.
I haven't seen her around before.

COOPER:
Is that so?

ZORBA:
You boys interested in a private dance?

SPACE COP:
If by "private dance", you mean a dance on my privates, then yes.

ZORBA:
Wonderful.
How about both of you at once?
I'm into trifectas.
I mean, ménage à troits?

COOPER:
No thanks, lady.
I don't float down that stream.

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
No homo.

COOPER:
Look, why don't you take my partner in the back first?
I'll go after him.

ZORBA:
All right, then.
You, come with me.
You, stay right there.
You're next.
I mean, you'll be next.

COOPER:
Hmm.

ZORBA:
Excuse me.
I'll take care of that.
Now there's a place for your gun.

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
Ehh, you like it rough, huh?

ZORBA:
You bet.
I'm gonna ride you like a Zorbelian mule.

SPACE COP:
How do you know what a Zorbelian mule is?

ZORBA:
How do you know what a Zorbelian mule is?

SPACE COP:
Fair point.
You must be new around here.
I haven't seen you before?

ZORBA:
I come from a small planet.
I mean, a small town.
I mean, let's talk about you.
Pay no attention to what I am doing.

SPACE COP:
I'm from the future.
The future of space.
Except in the future, my wife is dead.
In the past, she hasn't been born yet.
It's a good thing she hasn't been born yet, though.
I really doubt she'd approve of this lap dance.

COOPER:
A-ha!
I thought I smelled something fishy!
And it wasn't your lady clam.

ZORBA:
Don't try to stop us, humans.
Our mission is too important.

SPACE COP:
Ehh...
Guess I'm not getting my lap dance.

ZORBA:
Space Cop!
What are you doing?
Oh, my god!
You're ripping her fucking face off!
What the fuck?
What?
What the hell was that, Space Cop?
Come on!

COOPER:
Space Cop, who the hell was that?
Or rather, what the hell was that?

SPACE COP:
An alien.

COOPER:
An alien?
You mean like War of the Worlds or a martain?

SPACE COP:
No.
Mars is a dead planet with almost no atmosphere.
That thing was from Proximus Antari.
Aliens from there are mostly assholes.

COOPER:
Jesus.
Space Cop, are you saying that aliens are real?
Why didn't you tell me this?

SPACE COP:
You never asked.
Of course aliens are real.
In fact, I was chasing some of those guys the night I traveled back in time.
I wonder if she was with them.

COOPER:
Obviously, Space Cop!
Jesus Christ!
You're some kind of moron!
You know what?
You might be from the future, but I've met women smarter than you.
You, you, you're something else, Space Cop!
You're some kind of cosmic fuckup.
You're stupid.
You're lazy.
You're arrogant.
And you know what?
You only care about yourself.

SPACE COP:
No!
Back in the future, I did important police work.
I got to fly around, and I got to shoot things with my laser cannons.
Here, I get reprimanded every time I blow up a few apartment buildings.
It's bullshit.
Bullshit.
Back home, I was a hero, goddammit.

COOPER:
Space Cop, there is more to solving a case than violence and explosions.
You've got to use your mind and your wits.
The name of the company was Alian Steel.

SPACE COP:
So?

COOPER:
Ali-an.

SPACE COP:
Yeah, I know.

COOPER:
Ali-an.

SPACE COP:
I fail to see how I'm stupid when I know their name was Alien Steel.

COOPER:
Are you a fucking moron?
Tomorrow morning, I'm requesting a transfer.
We're no longer partners, Space Cop.

SPACE COP:
Fine!
I'll solve this case without your help.

ZORBA:
Disgusting.

ALIEN OFFICER:
We're almost out of bio-lube.
Soon we won't be able to synthesize any more human skin.

ZORBA:
That's okay.
We're almost at the final stage.

ALIEN OFFICER:
Bye.
I guess.
You're welcome.

AGNON:
Dr. Schumann.
How are things progressing?
Is the chromotanium alloy acceptable to you?

DR. SCHUMANN:
Yes.
It should withstand the pressure fine.
My work is almost complete.
I just need the final piece.

ZORBA:
It'll be here soon.
I'm going to get it tonight, in fact.
Getting into this location though is like breaking into a fortress.
Many security protocols to bypass.
But rest assured, I will get this item today.

SCIENTIST:
What the fuck?
Ow!
My face!

BARKEEPER:
You know, I don't usually let people pour themselves their own drinks, but looks like you're a man who's trying to kill himself with alcohol.
And considering you're wearing a Halloween costume and it's the middle of summer, I think I may be okay with it.

SPACE COP:
It's not a costume.
I'm a space cop.
A cop from the future.
The future of space.

BARKEEPER:
Sure, pal.
So, uh, what's got you so down?

SPACE COP:
My partner thinks I'm an idiot.

BARKEEPER:
Oh.
Does your boyfriend also wear a space police costume?

SPACE COP:
He's a partner in the cop sense of the word.

BARKEEPER:
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.

SPACE COP:
That, and my wife's dead.
Well, technically she's not even born yet.
She's dead in the future...of space.

BARKEEPER:
So how'd she die?

SPACE COP:
She was murdered.
Ugh, the present sucks.

BARKEEPER:
Listen, pally.
You can look at it this way.
If you're in the past, you got a clean slate.
You can change the future if you want.
And I'd start by quitting the booze.

SPACE COP:
Change the future.
Well, there it is.
The house of that bastard that killed my wife.

COMPUTER:
Activating nuclear rockets.

SPACE COP:
No.
I wantna see, see the look on that, that cocksucker's face when I pull the trigger.
Yeah.
There he is.

TIMMY'S DAD:
Don't play too long, Timmy.

TIMMY:
Okay, daddy.

SPACE COP:
I'm gonna get him.
I'm gonna shoot his face.
I don't give a fuck.
Tim Higgins?

TIMMY:
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

SPACE COP:
Is it all you have to say, you piece of shit?
Are you prepared to die for what you've done?
Or rather, what you will do?

TIMMY:
What?
Who are you?

SPACE COP:
I hope you remember my face when you're burning in hell, you filthy little cocksucker.

TIMMY:
Are you the clown for my birthday party?

TIMMY'S DAD:
Hey, who the hell are you?

SPACE COP:
Oh, no you don't.
I'm gonna get you for everything you're gonna do some day.
Smile, you son of a bitch.

DR. SNODGRASS:
I'll never recover from a disaster like this.
Six people dead.
One missing.
The lawsuit alone will end us.
Not to mention the bad PR.

COOPER:
Í'm sorry for your loss, Dr. Snodgrass.
I truly am.
Do you remember me?
I was in pod six over there.

DR. SNODGRASS:
Oh, yes.
Say, you look to be in good condition.
Any vomitting, loose stools, fluid build up in the ballsack?

COOPER:
All of the above, actually.
But I'm not here to talk about my balls, doctor.
I'm running on a hunch.
But I need to know what happened here on the night of the big break-in?

DR. SNODGRASS:
Two masked people broke in.
I think one was a woman.
The security tape showed they went straight for pod twelve, and spent time trying to disconnect it from the cooling unit.

COOPER:
Hmm.
Interesting.
Who was in pod twelve, doctor?

DR. SNODGRASS:
The next Albert Einstein, of course.
Schumann had some wild theories, which upset a lot of people.

COOPER:
What kind of theories?

DR. SNODGRASS:
Well...science.
Quantum physics.
A lot of people thought his ideas were dangerous.

COOPER:
Dangerous?
In what way, doctor?

DR. SNODGRASS:
Well, to be frank, he was a bit of a misanthrope.
He saw people as a sort of virus which the earth was infected with.
Ah.
I think this is it.
I guess I should label these.

COOPER:
Oh, my.
This must be horribly embarassing for you.
Fucking weirdo.

DR. SNODGRASS:
Found it.
I taped the news when it happened.

COOPER:
Pervert.

DENISE GRABOWSKI:
Just hours after announcing plans to go forward with his controversial new invention, Dr. Marcus Schumann was shot and killed by an angry mob representing the Human's First Movement earlier tonight.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Tonight, after securing my final component of enriched uranium from the US government, I am here to announce my intentions to go through with the construction and activation of my X-38 device.
This device will utter in an end for manki-...
I mean, a new age for mankind.
Did it sound like I was about to say "end"?
I didn't mean that at all.

DENISE GRABOWSKI:
However, just hours later, leaving his lab, protesters met him on the street.
A gun was pulled, and Dr. Schumann was shot in the back.
He was pronounced dead later that evening at Froedtert hospital.
So tonight, the scientific community mourns the loss, while protesters and activists around the world celebrate.
One thing will remain certain.
Dr. Marcus Schumann will remain a controversial figure for years to come.

COOPER:
Huh.
Very interesting, doctor.
But who would ever want to kill a scientist?
They do amazing things, like cure diseases and create atomic weapons.

DR. SNODGRASS:
Schumann was much more than a scientist.
His X-38 machine was so powerful, most people couldn't understand it.
Even scientists of the time.

COOPER:
So what did this X-38 machine do?

DR. SNODGRASS:
It was a source of great energy.
It would have revolutionized the world.
Eiminate the need for energy for thousands of years.

COOPER:
So you're saying this machine was some kind of new-fangled combustion engine?

DR. SNODGRASS:
It was a source of power based on an artificial singularity.

COOPER:
What?
Doctor, I don't understand a single thing you're sayingk.
And that's your fault.

DR. SNODGRASS:
A kind of man-made blackhole.
Skeptics were afraid the device, when activated, would collapse in on itself and eventually consume the earth.

COOPER:
The end of the world.

DR. SNODGRASS:
Essentially, yes.
Hippie groups felt man's manipulation of nature was going too far.
And I'm sure the energy companies feared him.
Who knows who actually carried out the assassination.

COOPER:
Did anyone else tried to continue his work?

DR. SNODGRASS:
No.
That was the genius of Marcus.
The only copy of the plans was in his head, which is why we froze it in hopes of retrieving the knowledge at some point in the future.

SPACE COP:
Go away.
Who is it?

COOPER:
Space Cop.
It's me, Cooper.

SPACE COP:
Oh.
Cooper, what do you want?
I'm, I'm trying to sleep in the back of my squad car, surrounded by filth.

COOPER:
Jesus Christ, Space Cop!
I can smell the booze throught the phone!
Listen.
I know what the aliens are up to, and it's no good.
We've got to act fast.

SPACE COP:
The who?

COOPER:
The aliens involved in the case.
Just trust me.

SPACE COP:
What?

COOPER:
Listen, Space Cop.
Tell me where you're at.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
We've got to get up into outer space real soon.

SPACE COP:
Where the fuck do you think I'm at?
I'm at the liquor store.

COOPER:
Just stay where you are, and don't shit your pants.

COOPER:
So if these aliens activate their doomsday weapon, it'll suck the earth into a blackhole.
We've got to stop them.
Space Cop, are you even listening to me?

SPACE COP:
Yeah, but my check engine light's on.

COOPER:
What?
Oh, my god!
Look out!
Check engine light?
What does that mean?

SPACE COP:
It means my power cells are almost depleted.
I wasn't expecting to take her back up into space.
This might be a one-way trip.

COOPER:
Well, if it is a one way trip, then let's make it count.

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
Let's save the earth.
Yeah.
Everything's going smoothly so far.

COOPER:
That's right.
No civilian casualties whatsoever.

SPACE COP:
What, what made you say that?

DR. SCHUMANN:
Did you get it?
The final component.
I need it.

ZORBA:
Yes.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Good.
Bring it here.
Now.
Hurry.
I need it.
Give it to me.
It's working.
It's working.

ALIEN OFFICER:
What?
Oh!
Oh!
Fuck!
Oh!
Oh!

DR. SCHUMANN:
Thanks for help, idiots!
Don't need you anymore!

GRIGG:
Bye.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Die, you alien scum!

COOPER:
Wow!

SPACE COP:
There it is.

COOPER:
My god, that's a big ship.

SPACE COP:
Damn.
According to my scans, the landing bay doors are closed.

COOPER:
Can't you just blow this ship up with your space cannons?

SPACE COP:
They have enough power for something like that.
Looks like we're gonna have to do this my way.

COOPER:
Oh god, do I even want to know what that means?

SPACE COP:
Transferring full power to the forward shields.
According to my calculations, we should cut through their hull like a hot knife through butter.
Or possibly like crayon through a brick wall.
I failed fourth grade math.

COOPER:
Space Cop, I don't have a seat belt.

SPACE COP:
Here we go.
Hold on.

COOPER:
Oh, my god!

SPACE COP:
That worked.
And we're right in the engine room, too.

COOPER:
Well, that was convenient.

SPACE COP:
Yeah.

COOPER:
You there!
We're looking for the man of the ship.
Do you know where we can find him?

SPACE COP:
Actually, I think she's the one who's in charge.
Or at least she was until someone shot here.

ZORBA:
Dr. Schumann betrayed us.
He killed Agnon and all of the other scientists.
We're all doomed.

COOPER:
Doomed?
What do you mean, doomed?

SPACE COP:
I say we kill her first and ask the questions later.

ZORBA:
We never wanted to make a weapon.
Our planet is dying.
We've run out of resources and power.
When we discovered Dr. Schumann's idea for the singularity machine, we tried to recreate it, but we failed.
He's the only one who knows how to make the golden cortex.
The brain of the machine.

SPACE COP:
Golden cortex?
Sounds like a sex act.
What are you, a pervert?

COOPER:
So what, you and your alien friends traveled back in time to find a scientist to get his blueprints?

ZORBAN:
Yes.
But he's a crazy man.
He never wanted to create an energy source.
His original plan was to destroy the earth.
And now his singularity machine is almost online in our laboratory.

COOPER:
All right.
Enough with the jibber-jabber, woman.
The men will take over from here.
Just tell us how to stop this guy.

ZORBA:
It may be too late.

COOPER:
What was that?
It's like the power is about to go off.

ZORBA:
It's the machine.
It needs a large amount of energy for the singularity.
Once it starts, it will consume and grow forever.

SPACE COP:
I'll stop it...with my gun.

COOPER:
Space Cop, not all problems can be solved with violence.
What we need here, people, is a solid plan of action.

ZORBA:
He's tapped into the ship's power core.
If we can transfer the energy, we can stop him.
There's a 90% chance that this will work.

SPACE COP:
I don't like those odds.

COOPER:
Space Cop, where are you going?

SPACE COP:
The laboratory.
I don't see any reason to fuck around with energy transfers when I can just go kill the bastard until he's dead.

COOPER:
Space Cop, you said we would work as a team.

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
I'm team winner.
You're team loser.
It's not for me, Cooper.
I gotta do it my way.
The Space Cop way.
The "get the bad guy before he gets away" way.
You two idiots can mess around with your science or whatever, while I kill Dr. Schumann until his plan doesn't work anymore.
That's my plan.
I'm Space Cop.
There was a wall right there.
Yeah, okay.
Here we go.

COOPER:
You're hopeless.
He's hopeless, you know, that Space Cop.
So, how do we shut this thing down?
What, is there like an on/off switch or something?

ZORBA:
It's not that simple.
You just can't shut it down, or the core will overload.
We have to transfer the power.

COOPER:
Transfer the power, you say?

SPACE COP:
I just realized, I have no idea where I'm going on this ship.
Hey, you!
Little boy.
Can you tell me where the science lab is?
I think I've got a crazy scientist to fight or something.

GRIGG:
You know, Space Cop, I never liked you.

SPACE COP:
I'm not that bad.
You only knew me a few days.

GRIGG:
You've done nothing but get in our way!
All we wanted to do is save our planet!
And now it's too late!

SPACE COP:
Oh.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Gee, you should have told me.
I'm not a monster.
I'd help you guys out.

GRIGG:
They're all dead, Space Cop.
My alien wife.
My alien family.
All 28 of my alien fucking babies.

SPACE COP:
Look, pal.
Are you gonna help me out or what?
I got shit to do.

GRIGG:
Help you?
I wanna fucking kill you, Space Cop.
I've got nothing left.
The only joy I'll get is seeing the look on your face when Earth is destroyed.
Watching you fail will give me what you humans call "a huge boner."

SPACE COP:
Oh.
That's weird.

GRIGG:
Why do you wanna save that place anyway?
Earth is fucking gross.
All those green trees, blue water.
Ugh.
Makes me wanna puke.

SPACE COP:
Earth's not that bad.
I mean, it's not as beautiful as Vesper 4 in the Orion cluster.
But, you know, it's got it's...

SPACE COP:
You've got a problem.
You're gonna die.
I did not think this through.

COOPER:
Uh, so Space Cop said his spaceship here is out of power.
Uh, his engine is dead.
So you are transfering power from the giant spark plug over to...

ZORBA:
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

COOPER:
Trust a woman to do a man's job?
Why, that goes against everything I believe in.
A woman's place is in the home, cooking and cleaning and making babies.
Why, the only time a woman should ever touch a car is to drive it to the grocery store, so she can buy groceries and then cook me dinner.

ZORBA:
Listen to me, mister.
You really need to upgrade your beliefs.
Now, I may be an alien, but human women of this time period can do everything a man can do.
Now let me transfer the power.
It's our only chance.

ALIEN:
Oh!
Thank god you're here, Space Cop!
We desperately need you to save us!
What?
What the fuck?

SPACE COP:
You fucker!

ALIEN:
Space Cop, what have you done to Joe?
No!
No!

ALIEN:
Space Cop, what are you doing?

ALIEN:
Oh, my god!
He's shooting at us!
Space Cop, no!
Stop!

ALIEN:
Space Cop!
Help!
Help!
He's gone mad.

ALIEN:
Oh, my god!
Space Cop...

SPACE COP:
Heads up.

ZORBA:
Detective Cooper, your turn.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Even though I'm just a brain in a jar, I can do anything.
Aren't you going to read me my rights, officer?

SPACE COP:
Yeah.
You have the right to remain a brain in a jar.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Die, fatso!

SPACE COP:
Quit it.
Ow.
Stop.
You're poking me right in the face.
I'm gonna get you, you stupid...

DR. SCHUMANN:
Fuck you!
Humans.
Weak.
Lazy.
Arrogant.

ZORBA:
Take the positive that's the right one, to the copper framing.
Don't hit the wires.
Negative to the titanium.
Lowest strung.
Good.
Watch the wires.

DR. SCHUMANN:
What?
What is going on?

COOPER:
It's working!
It's working!

DR. SCHUMANN:
Someone is draining the power from the ship's engine core.
Who could have come up with such a clever plan and outwitted me?

COOPER:
Whoa!
I did it!

ZORBA:
No!
We did it.

DR. SCHUMANN:
Well, if they think they can siphon off my power supply and stop me, they're dead wrong.
I'll find power elsewhere.
Hmm.
This is an interesting weapon, Space Cop.
My scanner indicates it has a polaron energy core.
That should be just what I need.
You see how fucking clever I am, Space Cop?

COOPER:
What is that noise?

DR. SCHUMANN:
It's working!
It's working!

ZORBA:
He's drawing his energy from another source.
We've got to get to the laboratory.

COOPER:
You're right.
I have to go to the bathroom, too.

ZORBA:
No.
The laboratory, not the lavatory.

COOPER:
Right.
Laboratory.
Let's go!

DR. SCHUMANN:
Almost there!
Soon I will have my revenge on the girl who dumped me in junior...
I mean, the planet Earth.

ZORBA:
Oh, no.
We're too late.
Come on.
We've got to do something.
There's not much time left.

COOPER:
Well, can we shut all this power down?
Is there, like, an outlet back here, a plug or something?

ZORBA:
No.
He's completely taken over the ship's computer systems.
He's connected to all of the ports.

DR. SCHUMANN:
I'm so cool!

ZORBA:
There's not much left I can do, but I think I have an idea.

COOPER:
Well, we gotta do something.
That screen says his power is almost at 100%.
When that happens, that glowing ball is gonna blow the Earth up or suck it into a vortex or something.
I really don't know what's going on anymore.
What are you doing with that thing?

ZORBA:
I'm attempting to upload a quantum virus into our computer system.
If successful, we may be able to gain access to his command codes.
If we could do that then, we can initiate the self-destruct sequence.

COOPER:
Huh.
Well, that was so simple.
Why didn't I think of that?

SPACE COP:
Because I didn't think.
I never do.

COOPER:
Well, Space Cop.
Looks like this is goodbye.
I'm being transfered to Chicago homicide.

SPACE COP:
Well, good luck with that.
Say, did you ever get your brain tumor looked at?

COOPER:
Oh, you know, I did.
It turns out I just had bad gas.
I was misdiagnosed.
Frozen for 60 years for no reason at all.
My wife died 10 years ago.
My children no longer know who I am.
I'm a total stranger to them.
In fact, everyone I've ever known and cared about my whole life is probably dead.
My doctor thinks I'm depressed.
So I'm on 16 types of antidepressants.
I have bad diarrhea every day.
I wake up sweating in a pool of my own vomit, thinking of putting a pistol to my head.
Maybe that will make the demons go away.
Space Cop?
Space Cop?

MAYOR OF MILWAUKEE:
On behalf of the City of Milwaukee and all of the world, we say to you Space Cop: Thank you!

SPACE COP:
Thankless fucking job.
Ugh.

TIMMY'S MOTHER:
Tim!
It's time for dinner!

TIMMY:
I'll be right there.
