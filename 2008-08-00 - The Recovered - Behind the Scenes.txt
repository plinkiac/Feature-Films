JOSH:
Hi. My name's Josh Davis. I'm running with superstarcastic.com and various other, uh, imaginary things. Our guests on the show tonight are Jay and Mike. They make movieses. Come on out guys. All right. Hey, good to see you. Hi, how you doing? Good to see you. All right, have a seat there. Have a seat there, all right. Okay, so, you made a movieses.

JAY:
We did. We made a movie.

JOSH:
You've made a number of movies, yes?

JAY:
Y-, uh, yes, we've made several movies...

JOSH:
Several movies.

JAY:
...that we made separately. This is the first thing that we sort of co-directed. Yeah.

JOSH:
Ah. Now how did that, how did you fellas decide to make a movie together?

MIKE:
Here we are on the set of Jackass 3. We only have one battery left, and are wasting it. And we're both going a little crazy.

TINA:
Hi.

MIKE:
We had never made a horror film.

JOSH:
Oh.

MIKE:
And, um...

JAY:
I think we, I, I personally was tired of, of what we were doing, what I was doing. I wanted to try something different.

MIKE:
Yeah, same here.

JAY:
Yeah.

JOSH:
Um, so talk bit, a little bit about the casting.

JAY:
Why don't you field that one, Mike?

MIKE:
Oh, no. Go ahead, go ahead, please.

JAY:
No, no. I, I insist.

MIKE:
I think I probably have horrible bags under my eyes because we were out drinking and, um...a lot. And I slept on a floor. And I had a piece of wood, like, shoved into my neck the whole night. Oh, and I slept on towels as a pillow. Yeah, I, I feel kind of gross today. But we just, yeah, we concluded two long days of auditions.

JAY:
For the most part, we tried actually casting this one, which was an awful experience, because everybody was terrible.

JOSH:
Really?

JAY:
Everybody sucked.

ACTOR:
How was work?

JAY:
Oh, that's me, actually.

ACTOR:
Work was work. Oh, but there was this insane guy sitting on the bench in front of the building this morning.

ACTOR:
Ranting at random people walking by about what an asshole Albert Einstein was.

ACTOR:
He was saying some theories that didn't hold up today, or something. He was just yelling at people in the subway. The guy was nuts.

MIKE:
I don't wanna talk about it.

JAY:
It's a source of...

MIKE:
It's traumatic, it's traumatic.

ACTOR:
Hey, that reminds me. There's a sal-, there's a saloon...

JAY:
"Sloan."

ACTOR:
There's a Sloan of opportunities...oh.

JAY:
What?

ACTOR:
Sorry. What is that?

JAY:
"There was a Sloan in the obituary."

ACTOR:
"Oh, obituaries." Sorry. "Doesn't feel that long. And that reminds me. There was a saloon in the bobituaries yesterday." Sorry. Doesn't feel that long. Hey, that reminds me. There's a saloon in the bobituaries yesterday, and I was thinking, maybe it was your mom."

MIKE:
We, we just did one interview. And there maybe another, but we may leave...

JAY:
I think that we're gonna leave right now.

MIKE:
We're gonna leave. Yeah, we're just gonna leave then. We're gonna go to the titty bar, um, drink ourselves stupid, and, uh, get a few auditions of our own. Best lapdance. Best lapdance in Orfordville.

JOSH:
Obviously, we've got, um, what we refer to very affectionately as B-level celebrities.

JAY:
There's really only one celebrity, though.

TINA:
I like to pick my toes, and, um, sometimes, um, I like to cut my hair in funny, funny shapes, and, uh, sell the, the bottom parts of the hair to the needy. And then I noticed that, that they take it and they smoke it.

MIKE:
Oh, my god.

TINA:
And I was very confused about that. And then I asked, "Why would you do that?" Because of the amount of pot that I have smoked from the time I was born to now, that there's so much THC running through my hair, that it gives them a great high.

JAY:
Well, we have Tina Krause in the movie, who's been in numerous, numerous, countless movies. I think last count was, uh, was 623 movies that she's done.

MIKE:
She's been in a lot.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
She's been in a lot.

JAY:
47 of those are vampire lesbian movies. Had you seen Tina in anything before, aside from some of the Santo shorts?

JOSH
I had never...Santo, what?

MIKE:
So, you reference Oranges: she was a voice.

JAY:
Oh, that's right. She was a voice in Oranges originally, but you didn't end up using it.

MIKE:
I didn't end up using it.

TINA:
I think what happened was, a while back, I think I was a sexy orange.

MIKE:
Well, we know a filmmaker named Jason Santo who used Tina in a couple of short films he did.

TINA:
"Richard Queso" and his lovely self decided to have me sit in his room and, and, do, uh, do this whole sexy orange thing. And then, so, Richard Queso decided to talk to "Spacey", and, uh, they got together and did a little dih-duh-duh, and I guess Spacey thought it was some brilliant concoction. They gave me a ring and say, "Hey, wanna be in this film?"

MIKE:
There's gonna be lots of blood in a few minutes. Lots of blood.

GIRL:
Where?

MIKE:
Everywhere.

GIRL:
Die.

WOMAN:
Right now?

JAY:
Die right now, action!

WOMAN:
Really?

JAY:
We need a little bit more light over here.

WOMAN:
Be sure not to step in it.

MIKE:
I'm getting it all over the carpet.

GIRL:
How are you gonna clean all that off?

TINA:
Well, I happen to like Milwaukee, uh, especially because it's the only place that I can swerve out of the road for a case of beer. I didn't study the script before I got there. Don't get mad. It's just my way. All right? Read it on the plane.

JAY:
I was the only one that knew what was going on, wasn't I?

TINA:
You might've been.

JAY:
Yeah.

MIKE:
Actually, maybe like, start it off a little like normal pace, and once you realize that, that something's changed, slow it down a little.

MIKE:
Action!

DIXIE:
So, on a scale of 10 to 10, ten being the worst, and ten being the worst, how much did you hate working on this movie?

TINA:
10.

DIXIE:
Okay. These questions suck. Oh, where did that hospital gown go, because I don't know, how far...

MIKE:
Tell 'em, explain what you're doing, Dixie.

DIXIE:
I'm putting makeup on this lovely young lady, and making her look all dead and gross.

JAY:
Okay, let's do a poll. Uh, how wrong will this go, Dixie? Very, very, very, very wrong.

JAY:
Tina?

DIXIE:
I have hope for us, only hope.

JAY:
Mike?

MIKE:
There's not many ways that this could go right.

MIKE:
Action! Oh, my god. The cord came undone!

JAY:
Okay.

MIKE:
The cord is stuck.

JAY:
Mike, explain what just happened.

MIKE:
I started to get the photos flying up, like, and it started to look awesome, like, the paper's blowing, and I moved it, and the cord was caught on something and it unplugged the, it unplugged the leaf blower. This hi-tech Hollywood special effect. But it looked cool!

TINA:
Really, honestly, it felt like I was a schoolteacher for special ed. It was rough. It was rough. I mean, the buffoons. I don't, you, you call yourself a professional team, for fuck's sake? What was that?

JAY:
She probably thought we were incompetent at that point.

MIKE:
I think she probably thought that much earlier.

JAY:
She probably thought, yeah, from the very beginning when we drove from the airport and couldn't find the car.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
That's when she knew she was in safe hands.

JOSH:
Ah, that's good, good from the beginning, all right.

DIXIE:
During the shooting, both you and the director had no idea what was going on in the film. Do you think that that added to the sense of mental confusion the characater was enduring?

TINA:
Absolutely. This is what we call method acting, okay? This is when, when the director is so slick that he doesn't tell you anything, and he, he lets you figure it out. Of course, I'm supposed to be "mental", okay? And so, in trying to figure it out, you lose your mind when you're running around in the cold.

TINA:
I'm freezing.

MIKE:
Are you getting cold from that fan?

TINA:
I am so cold.

MIKE:
Really?

DIXIE:
You have no idea.

TINA:
It was, uh, cold. Cold. Because, then, that's not really acting, that was really losing my mind. I'd like to thank you, Spacey.

DIXIE:
You know, I had a, um, a prosthetic piece for a slit throat.

MIKE:
Oh, really?

DIXIE:
Mm-hmm. I wore it on my neck on for that prom thing.

TINA:
Um, Dixie is going to kill me. She's gonna be like, what happened to all of my shit?

MIKE:
Screwed up all her birthday scene. You're doing wonderful work, Tina. You're doing wonderful. Rarely is the lead actress also the main makeup person.

TINA:
It's rarely that.

TINA:
Dead?

MIKE:
Rolling?

JAY:
Rolling.

MIKE:
That was terrible.

JAY:
Ooh, that was a good one.

MIKE:
That was a good one?

JAY:
It was, like, gurgling.

MIKE:
Wait, I got better ones. I got better ones.

JAY:
It gets better!

TINA:
I got better ones!

DOUGLAS:
Have a drag of a cigarette, and you'll be ready.

DIXIE:
How was it for you?

DOUGLAS:
It was a thrilling experience. I loved the cigarettes.

JAY:
Mike, Mike, what are we shooting next?

MIKE:
Um, what am I supposed to say? Something funny?

DOUGLAS:
Here comes another one. Don't drill into her head.

JAY:
Wait. Don't drill into her head?

MIKE:
No.

JAY:
Okay. I won't.

TINA:
Oh.

JAY:
I guess.

JAY:
Okay, we just shot the last shot of the movie with Tina Krause.

TINA:
Thank god, it's cold!

JAY:
There's three of us. Me and Tina. All right, Mike. Explain what's going on here.

MIKE:
We're taking photos of Tina for possible box art use, or promotional use, etc.

JOSH:
Uh, are there outtakes in the credits, in the Smokey and the Bandit-style?

MIKE:
There are actual outtakes in the movie.

JOSH:
Oh, okay. All right.

MIKE:
Yeah. These aren't outtakes. These are actual scenes. Normally on DVD's, they have, uh, deleted scenes. But in ours, they're gonna have scenes they didn't shoot.

DIXIE:
Jay Bauman has often been referred to as the worst filmmaker of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. And Mike Stoklasa recently made Forbes magazine's Top 10 Biggest Frauds Ever award. What was it like working with this unlikely filmmaking duo?

TINA:
Well, let's see. Um, much like Kevin Spacey, Mike has very little to say, okay? Jay might be the happiest person I ever met in my life. Um, it was wonderful.

JAY:
That's what I'm here for!

TINA:
No, they're not really the worst filmmakers. I can, um, I can point out a few. Um...

MIKE:
Please do.

JAY:
Would you like to burn some bridges?

TINA:
I love them, it was great. The movie's wonderful. You should watch it. I cry. My eyes are swollen. They'll never go back to their normal nice...
	
DIXIE:
Cucumbers!

TINA:
No, I tried cucumbers. Shit, I tried the whole salad. Nothing worked. I did, with cucumbers. But cucumbers are good for other things. What?

DIXIE
And, cut!

MIKE:
Here, let me hold your cigarette.

DIXIE
I did it, I did it. There we go.

MIKE:
All right. The location of the premiere. A backyard with plastic chairs. What are you drinking, Dixie?

DIXIE:
Four Loko. It's, uh...

MIKE:
Why is it called Four Loko?

DIXIE:
Because it's made with four essential nutrients...

MIXIE:
Like alcohol...

DIXIE:
Booze.

MIKE:
Sugar.

DIXIE:
Energy. Yummy. And illegal.

MIKE:
Oh, yeah. It should be mandatory for the festival, for the festival operators, that once you finish a beer, that it should be thrown at the screen. It needs be a rule. Okay, show me the steak.

JAY:
There's, there's three of us here. There's, there's Mike, myself, and Dixie. And we have a fourth one that we're cooking for, uh, Tina, even though she won't be here.

MIKE:
Aww.

JAY:
Aww. Tina, this one's for you.

MIKE:
That wasn't in focus.

DIXIE:
Steak forever!
