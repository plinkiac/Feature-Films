MIKE:
Hello, and welcome to the commentary track for Gorilla Interrupted.
I am Mike Stoklasa.

RICH:
I am Richard William Thomas Evans III.

JAY:
And I am Jay Bauman.
I play Dex in the movie.

MIKE:
I, I play, uh, Sid in the movie.

RICH:
I play Rich Evans in the movie.

MIKE:
Also known as Ray Grabowski.

RICH:
Oh, yes.
Ray Grabowski.

MIKE:
A distant relateive to Cliff Grabowski of the Grabowski's fame.

JAY:
We're the Grabowski's, wild and free.

MIKE:
Well, Jay.
Why don't you talk about this opening shot.

JAY:
Well, this is, uh, an idea I had, because obviously this is a whole new opening for the movie.
We re-edited the entire thing.
And I thought it would be funny to start with this sort of epic, cinematic music, and then just hard-cut to Rich sitting in a chair, eating potato chips.
And then the, uh, zooming out of the planet shot was done by our friend Jack.

MIKE:
It, it, it looks fantastic.

JAY:
It, it looks like an effect in Gorilla Interrupted should look.

MIKE:
Yes.

JAY:
And these opening titles are obviously Superman-inspired.

RICH:
So why, why the 8-bit font?

JAY:
I don't know.
It just kind of felt appropriate, like, with this piece of music.
And then just the music itself is so sort of low-tech.
I think of old video games.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH
And I, I do like the Superman credits, though, that fly at you.
That's great.

MIKE:
Did you intentionally put my name in these opening credits 11 times?

JAY:
You know what, I actually followed the opening credits of the original edit for the most part.
That's why it says it's produced by me and Rich.
Even though I don't think either of us did any actual producing on the film.

RICH:
It was, it was at our place where it was filmed.

JAY:
I guess you, you have more right for that than I do.

MIKE:
You get associate producer credits, sure.

RICH:
Right, right there, that, that is my grandmother's old house.

JAY:
Did you know these neighbors at all?

RICH:
Actually, I dion't, I think that house was abandoned.

JAY:
Oh.
We should have filmed there.

RICH:
It was abandoned for most of my childhood.
I think, like, three or four different people lived there and...

MIKE:
I remember seeing people live there.

RICH:
They were living there for, like, months at a time, though.
For most of my childhood, that house was empty.

JAY:
Hm.

MIKE:
Yeah.
So this is my parents' basements now.
And, uh, that's, uh, our friend Brett's parents's basement.
Uh, so different house in two different basements.

RICH:
Well, here's three distinct different locations.

MIKE:
Three distinct different locations, and, uh, doubling for one at the time.
Well, two, technically.

RICH:
This, this little room, that is Mike's basement.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
Mike's old basement.
And then where the drummer was, that was, that's Brett, and that's Brett's basement.

MIKE:
Yep.

RICH:
Me in the chair, that's my grandmother's house.

MIKE:
Yeah.

JAY:
The best one is when we start cutting to my shitty old apartment that doesn't match any of these locations at all.
But it's supposed to be my kitchen and, uh, uh, the hooker scene is Ray's bedroom.

MIKE:
Mm-hmm.

JAY:
Although it's a completely different bedroom than it is earlier in the movie.

MIKE:
Yeah.
Well, it could be anywhere.

JAY:
I suppose.

MIKE:
It could be the hooker's bedroom.

JAY:
That's true.
So, yeah.
That was Illinois.
Now we're in Wisconsin.

MIKE:
Right.
And that is not the camera we filmed the movie on.
That's probably a better camera.

JAY:
We probably should've filmed the movie on that camera.

MIKE:
Teah.
That was a Hi8 camera, right?

JAY:
Uh...no.
This is, this was a MiniDV camera...

MIKE:
No, the one that I picked up.

JAY:
Oh, maybe.
I don't remember.

MIKE:
That was your old Hi8 camera.

JAY:
Oh, that was mine?
I, I have no memory of that.

MIKE:
This was shot on a MiniDV camera, um, made by Sharp.

JAY:
Yes.

MIKE:
Which is probably the worst manufacturer of electronics.
Other than, other than Coby, the knockoff brand of Sony.

JAY:
I actually destroyed the camera we shot this on with a, with a hammer years later on camera.

MIKE:
Ah.

JAY:
I, I filmed myself destroying it.

RICH:
That seems incredibly wasteful.
