You tell me, Marx.
Wages are determined by the fierce struggle between capitalist and worker.
Oh.
Oh, my body.
Oh.
Yeah?
Oh, sorry.
I must have the wrong number.
I was looking for Julie.
No, you have the right number.
This is Julie.
Who are you?
What?
Your name's Julie?
Yeah, and I was just getting hot and bothered reading about Marxist political economy.
Well, sorry, but I was looking for another Julie.
Oh, what, I'm not good enough for you now?
You insensitive asshole.
I don't even know you!
Prick.
At least I have you, Marx.
Oh, god.
The demand for men necessarily regulates the production of men as every other commodity.
Oh, god, we're commodities.
Oh, we're commodities.
We're commodities.
We're commodities.

Dino, dino, doo doo doo.
Yeah?
Oh, sorry.
I must have the wrong number.
I was looking for Julie?
No, you have the right number.
This is Julie.
What?
Your name's Julie?
Who are you?
Well, sorry, but I was looking for another Julie.
What, I'm not good enough for you now?
I don't even know you!
You insensitive asshole.
