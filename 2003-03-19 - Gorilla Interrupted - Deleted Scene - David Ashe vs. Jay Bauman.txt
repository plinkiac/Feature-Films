Oh, sorry.
I must have the wrong number.
I was looking for Julie.

JULIE:
No, you have the right number.
This is Julie.
Who are you?

DEX:
What?
Your name's Julie?
Yeah, and I was just getting hot and bothered reading about Marxist political economy.

DEX:
Well, sorry, but I was looking for another Julie.

JULIE:
Oh, what?
I'm not good enough for you now?
You insensitive asshole.

DEX:
I don't even know you!

JULIE:
Prick.
At least I have you, Marx.
Oh, god.

Oh, god, we're commodities.
Oh, we're commodities.
We're commodities.
We're commodities.

JULIE:
Dino, dino, doo doo doo.

I was looking for Julie?

JULIE:
No, you have the right number.
This is Julie.

DEX:
What?
Your name's Julie?

JULIE:
Who are you?

DEX:
Well, sorry, but I was looking for another Julie.

JULIE:
What, I'm not good enough for you now?

DEX:
I don't even know you!

JULIE:
You insensitive asshole.
