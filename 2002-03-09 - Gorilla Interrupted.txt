SILLY:
Oh, Slappy. I can't believe it's already Christmas Eve. We better get to bed nice and early so we can wake up for Christmas. I hope I get a dolly.

SLAPPY:
Oh, Silly. I agree. The Tuck-In Train's coming into the station early tonight.

DEX:
Well, unsheath it.

SID:
I don't know, mate. I'm too excited.

DEX:
It was a lot of hard work.

SID:
Yeah. Well, I don't care. Okay. Well, let's make this official. Greg. Drumroll, please. Here goes nothing. Rock! This is some mighty fine craftsmanship you did here, mate.

DEX:
Now, I've modified the sound system with a nuclear accelerator that, uh, that'll send out sound waves that--

SID:
Rock?

DEX:
I guess, that's one way to put it.

SID:
So no one will rock harder than me?

DEX:
Well, I dunno--

SID:
Say it, asshole. No one will rock harder than me.

DEX:
Fine. No one will rock harder than you. Now, the, the thing of it...

SID:
Don't touch the guitar, mate. Now, let's go say we try this thing out, eh?

DEX:
I'd put on some earplugs if I were you.

SID:
Fuck off!

SILLY:
Let's dance, everybody! I can't believe it's already Christmas Eve. We better get to bed nice and early so we can wake up for Christmas.

SID:
This is Sid, ladies and gentlemen! The world's best performance on the superbass superband!

RAY:
Those cocksuckers are even thinking about playing that goddamned punk music.

SID:
And no ordinary guitar will do for this frontman. I've got the greatest superpowered guitar ever! We're gonna take the planet by storm, and it all starts now! Let's do the slang! Are you ready, Grig? Are you ready to rock? Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!

RAY:
All right, look, you little...aughh! Oh!

SID:
Hey. Who the fuck is that guy? You skunk, fuck you! Ruin me performance! I'll show you! Hey, hey, what the fuck is wrong with you? Interrupting me rock set!

RAY:
What? What? Ow! The fuck is wrong with you? How loud do you need to be?

SID:
As loud as I want to, because I rock! You, sir...are a pussyfart.

DEX:
Hey, Sid. Are you gonna pay me for that guitar? Look, I'm, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was gonna be as loud as it was.

RAY:
Ah, it's fine. I'm just sick of it. Why do you let those assholes practice here, anyway?

DEX:
I dunno. I've known Sid since I was a kid, and it's always nice to have company over when I'm working on new projects.

RAY:
Projects? You're a menace. What do you make here, anyway? Nucular bombs?

DEX:
Actually, it's "nuclear" bombs. And, yes, in fact, just the other day, I got an order from this guy, Machmed. Says he has to blow up an important building...

RAY:
Shut up. I don't wanna hear your life's story. Don't you have any friends?

DEX:
Uh, hey! You wanna see my new project?

RAY:
No.

RAY:
Jesus. What is it?

DEX:
I call it...a battlepack.

RAY:
What is it used for?

DEX:
I dunno. Battles?

RAY:
What does it do?

DEX:
It battles. Really well, actually. See, it's powered by this engine that I designed that uses quarks as an energy source.

RAY:
What the quark is a fuck? I mean, what the quark is a quark? I mean, what the quark is a fuck...

DEX:
A quark is a sub...

RAY:
I mean, what the fuck is a...what the fuck is a quark?

DEX:
A quark is a subatomic particle. When unleashed, it creates a tremendous amount of energy. I've channeled that energy to polarize the steel, so it's ultraresistant to attack. And now, the battlepack can let loose streams of energy that can melt diamond.

RAY:
My god. You built it in your mother's basement.

DEX:
My mom's dead.

RAY:
Oh.

DEX:
Just my dad lives here.

RAY:
Oh.

DEX:
He beats me.

RAY:
Okay.

DEX:
Hard. Anyway, I'm thinking of selling my design to the United States Army. I figured it'd be good at, you now, rooting out terrorists. Hey, maybe that guy Machmed would want one, too.

RAY:
Yeah, look, uh, Animal Planet's got a Gentle Ben special on tonight. I gotta get going.

DEX:
Oh, okay. Uh, well, again, Ray, I'm sorry about the noise. I hope I didn't piss you off.

RAY:
Oh, it's okay. I get pissed off pretty easily.

ALIEN:
Damn! The alien sensors aboard my spaceship cannot locate this battlepack. It's the most powerful source of energy in the galaxy, and I can't locate it with my alien sensors. Apparently, it leaks out too much interference radiation. I can only pinpoint it's location to a square mile. But, apparently, if my alien scientists aboard this alien spaceship can work just a bit harder on, on updating our sensors, I can locate more accurately on where it's at. We must find this source of energy. We must use it to destroy the population on this planet, so we can conquer...and rape! Rape!

RAY:
Where were you?

ELSIE:
Shopping. What does it look like?

RAY:
Oh, you were shopping on a Saturday? Most places close at 5 or 6, not 11 at night.

ELSIE:
I was at a friend's house. What are you accusing me of?

RAY:
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. What makes you think I'd accuse you of something?

ELSIE:
You know, Ray, I'm being real fucking sick of your attitude. You're becoming a real asshole.

RAY:
I'm becoming an asshole? What about you? You've become a fucking whore.

ELSIE:
I don't have to take this. I don't!

RAY:
You're taking something, all right. You're taking cock!

ELSIE:
Why don't you lay off the booze, you fucking drunk?

RAY:
The booze is the only thing I have going for me, bitch!

ELSIE:
What about me, huh? I thought you said you loved me?

RAY:
Go fuck yourself!

ELSIE:
Go fuck your mom!

RAY:
You cocksucking whore! What's this, huh, huh? I work all goddamn day in a steel mill for this! Do you really need another sweater? What is the rest of this crap, goddammit! They can go back to, you're running up the bill, for what?

ELSIE:Go to bed, you asshole. Before I call the fucking police.

RAY:
Fucking bitch. Go away, Elsie. I don't wanna talk to anyone. What?

ALIEN 1:
I dunno. He doesn't look that smart.

ALIEN 2:
Hmm. What do you think? Anal probe?

ALIEN 1:
Ehh...sure.

RAY:What the fuck?

ALIEN 2:
Oh, god! Hes getting up!

RAY:
Oh! Ow, I can't see!

ALIEN 1:
No, no!

RAY:
Oh, oh, my god! Oh, my god! Aliens? What the fuck? Aliens? Ow, my eyes!

ALIEN:
All that sensitive alien equipment!

RAY:
What the fuck is going on here? Oh!

ALIEN 1:
Don't touch that!

RAY:
Oh! What?

ALIEN 2:
No, no, no, no, no!

RAY:
Oh! Ow, my face! Oh, weird alien rays are emitting...ceiling...and they're hitting me in the face!

ALIEN 1:
The gorilla formula is highly unstable! We have to beam him off board! Quickly! Where are the buttons? I can't find the button!

DEX:
So then I realized that if the anti-protons were reversed, it could double the energy output. I, I mean, it was an amazing breakthrough! Then all of the photons all lined up, and I could cause their atoms to fuse with the applicationo of some mild radiation...plug. Why are you stabbing yourself with a fork?

JULIE:
Dunno.

DEX:
I'm sorry. I know this must be boring you.

JULIE:
No, Dex. I mean, I love to hear what you do, but...not really in that kind of detail.

DEX:
Yeah, sorry. Sometimes I just get excited.

JULIE:
I don't even know what you're talking about. But I can see the results. I'll never forget the time in the fifth grade when you spelled my name out with the big lasers at the science fair.

DEX:
Oh, yeah. That.

JULIE:
I mean, you spelled it wrong. But, still, it was cute.

DEX:
So, uh, what have you been up to?

JULIE:
Just, studying a lot, I guess.

DEX:
Neat.

JULIE:
Listen, Dex, I gotta be at work, so I'll see you later, okay?

DEX:
Oh, okay. Bye. Talking about science. I should've told her that she smelled nice, or that she looked pretty...I'm stupid. Ugh, I forgot to take off my lab coat. Oh, god! And I'm wearing my Star Trek shirt. Jesus.

SID:
Hey, Julie, how you doing?

JULIE:
Sid, what''s up?

SID:
Hey, you visiting that little guy, Dex, huh? Yeah, he's become quite the scientist, hasn't he?

JULIE:
Yeah, he is.

SID:
Yeah, he built this here nuclear guitar. In fact, I'm gonna use this heinous axe on Friday night at me show! It's gonna rock! Yeah, I think it would be most wicked if you came.

JULIE:
Yeah, I, I'd like that.

SID:
Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, yeah?

JULIE:
All right, I'm gonna be going then, Sid. I'll see you later.

SID:
Right, all right, yeah. Yeah, I'll see you later. Rock, yeah.

RAY:
Oh, man. What the fuck?

JACOB:
Here comes the great white hunter, stalking his prey at dawn. He has super intellect, super senses, he has...just dropped his gun. Wait a minute.

RAY:
Oh! Ah! Oh! Ow, my god! Ow, god, god! The branches! They hurt! Oh! Ugh! Aw! Aw! Broken glass is in my eye! Ow, my fucking eye! Aw, ah! Fuck! Ow, my ass! Son of a bitch! Who the fuck put this steep hill here? Ah, ugh! Ow, ow, my fucking foot!

JACOB:
A man that transforms into a beast! My white whale has breached the water at last. Manbeast, you are mine.

LESIE:
Now who's being suspicious?

RAY:
Go fuck yourself.

ELIE:Go fuck yourself, okay?

JACOB:
The manbeast!

ELSIE:
You accuse me of god knows what last night, when I came in at 11pm. You've been gone for 24 fucking hours, you asshole. Not even a phone call, huh? Where were you last night, huh? Where were you?

RAY:
I woke up in the woods, all right? I woke up in the fucking woods!

ELSIE:
You need to lay off the booze!

RAY:
I wasn't fucking drinking, you cuntragf! I woke up in the goddamn woods, and I don't know why.

JACOB:The manbeast has a mate. Why don't I have a mate?RAY:I wasn't fucking drinking, all right?

JACOB:
They're fighting. Maybe she'll break up with him.
RAY:
And I don't know how I got there!

JACOB:
Maybe she'll go out with me.

RAY:What about that don't you understand?

JACOB:
He transforms at will!

ELSIE:
You just turned into a gorilla.

RAY:A what?

ELSIE:
You just turned into a fucking gorilla.

RAY:I turned into a what?

ELSIE:
I bet you still have a puny little dick.

JACOB:
Oh, foul thing. What evil god created thee?

ELSIE:
That's it. I am leaving.

RAY:
Fine, then! Good riddance!

ELSIE:
What is this, a fucking joke? How did you do it? You're a fucking gorilla.

RAY:
A gorilla? Elsie, what are you talking about? Are you on drugs?

ELSIE:No, you're the one that's on drugs. You're insane. Ugh, I can't believe this. Have a nice life, asshole.

RAY:Fine, then. Good riddance.

JACOB:
Ow! I didn't say that. I'm not in here. Big fucking ape.

DEX:
Be careful with those power couplings! Oomjabib!

OOMJABIC:
Sir, we've discovered the location of the battlepack.

ALIEN 1:
You've discovered the location of the battlepack?

OOMJABIC:
Yes, sir. But there's a problem.

ALIEN 1:
What is that problem, Munjabib.

OOMJABIC:
Well, we've only been able to narrow down its location to one square mile.

ALIEN:
Oh. This is indeed a stressing problem. I want you to bring five of your best men to be terransurface to search for the...battlepack. Meanwhile, I will still stay here.

OOMJABIC:
Understood, sir.

ALIEN 1:
Excellent. Munjabib, give your men this Pepsi of crystal as a reward.

RAY:Fucking son of a...

SID:
Hey! Asshole. You mind if I test out me guitar now?

DEX:
Yeah, sure. But only if you promise to wear earplugs this time. I'm serious about that.

SID:
Ah, fuck earplugs. All right, Grig. Let's do this again! Give me a beat! Yeah! What the...! Holy shit!

RAY:
Goddammit! They do this every fucking morning!

DEX:
What's going on?

SID:
Aliens.

DEX:
Cool. No better time to test this out than now. You wanna kill some aliens?

SID:
Do I?

JACOB:
Die, manbeast! Augh! Don't shoot at me! Aughh! I'm not the enemy here. The manbeast is. I'm soiled my drawers.

ALIEN 1:

ALIEN 2:
You didn't say he was so powerful!

ALIEN 1:
I didn't know, dickhead!

ALIEN 2:
Run away!

JACOB:
Ow! Ow! Ow, my head! Ow! Damn you, manbeast! With this symbol of Christianity, I sentence you to hell! I killed it. The rarest creature on earth. And I killed it. Wauugh, die you, pigfoo-...

SID:
Which one of you buggers wants it?

RAY:
Hey! You two! What the fuck are you doing?

DEX:
I don't know. Shooting these aliens?


SID:
Fuck you!
Now, some of you seem to think I have a condition called Anger Management Disorder.
My girlfriend thinks it's caused by the booze.
I can assure you all, I was a much bigger prick before the booze.
I think you're a big asshole.
Listen, you little punk.
A real big asshole.
The last 24 hours, I've woken up in the woods with a swollen anus.
My girlfriend has left me, saying I turn into a giant gorilla.
This asshole has been chasing me around, trying to kill me.
And now, men in obviously bad alien costumes have been running around my house, and you pissweasels seem to have something to do with it.
Now, before I sue every one of you for every dime you've ever made in your entire weasley, cocksucking lives, I wanna know, what is going on.
But you did turn into a gorilla.
He did.
Who is this guy?
And why is he dressed up as a safari man?
My name is Jacob Spaulding, the African explorer.
Greatest hunter of the Union Jack.
I was stalking big game in the name of the crown, when I saw this, a cursed manbeast.
Manbeast?
Tainting the countryside with his curse of violence...and rape!
Rape!
Damn you, manbeast!
Wait, you said you were hunting big game?
What big game?
Deer.
Deer isn't big game.
I wasn't hunting just deer.
I was trying to shoot pigeons, too.
Pigeons aren't big game, either.
I saw a racoon.
And a squirrel.
And a very small dog.
I think it was a Scottish terrier.
Those aren't big game, either.
What was that about rape?
You know, I bit the head off a bat, once.
Go back to that manbeast part.
You were a manbeast.
You are a manbeast.
Why, today, when those men in poor alien costumes laid siege, you became the very image of Lucifer himself.
Wait, guys.
I think those were real aliens.
I mean, I shot their spacecraft.
In fact, if it wasn't for me, we would all be dead right now.
So I think you all need to start treating me with a little more respect.
And, Sid, you owe me for that guitar.
Sod off, you pissweasel.
Fuck you, you cock...ass...nut.
Oh, look at this.
Oh, what about the manbeast?
Manbeast.
I learned about this at Yale.
You see, like the man turning into the legendary werewolf at the sight of a full moon, you apparently turn into a gorilla when you get mad.
When you stubbed your toe on that log in the forest, you became a simian, an ape, a monkey man.
An ape of superhuman intelligence and strength.
yeah, right.
What?
What the fuck?
You see!
You are a manbeast!
Your rage is already taking control!
I'm not angry.
I'm okay.
I'm--
You son of a cunt disease, I'm gonna shave your balls with--
Are you angry now?
I just threw toilet paper at your face.
Turn into an ape, I wanna see it.
Don't make him angry!
Yes!
I want to see him turn into a monkey man!
Well, I'll be slain.
Mother have mercy.
Shut up.
Go fuck yourselves.
Fuck you, you asshole.
Eat shit.
This is all just a goddamn practical joke.
I'm not playing this game.
I want to see you turn into a monkey!
What the fuck is your problem, you son of a bitch!
Oh.
Oh, hey, what's this?
Is that sauce?
Is this Saucy McSauce-a-lous, (?)
I like to drink the man juice, because I'm a Saucy McSauce-a-lous.
You fools!
Don't...make...me...angry.
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
I do like you when you're angry.
I do!
Turn into a monkey!
Auuuughhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Holy mercy.
It's a manbeast!
Ow!
No, we're all doomed!
He will destroy us all!
Let me out of these chains!
Oh, crap, there's go my bladder.
Oh!
Oh, no.
My colon is swollen.
We're doomed!
Okay.
Well, I'm a monkey now.
Yeah, we noticed.
Listen, we're gonna take off, but give us a holler if any more aliens show up.
Right?
Come on, mate.
Bye.
Don't leave me here with him!
The monkey man is the devil!
The monkey man must be destroyed!
He must be--ow, there goes my bladder again.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, don't talk about the aliens, or the manbeast, or the laser.
Definitely don't talk about the laser.
My lab coat.
Hey, you.
Hey, Julie.
So, uh, I was thinking we could maybe go to the movies and catch that new Meg Ryan romatnic comedy?
Yeah, those movies are so stupid.
I mean, don't ya think?
I guess so, I just...figured you're a girl, and like crap like that.
Wait, that didn't come out right.
Listen, I have an idea.
Why don't you let me decide what we do tonight.
Um, okay.
Come on, let's go have some fun.
What?
My friend, Guy, says science is for fags, but, I dunno, it's just my calling, and I'm--
What's he doing here?
Hey.
Dex, Sid invited me to watch his band Electronic Enema play.
I figured you'd wanna go cuz you built his guitar and all.
Actually, now we're called Superpowered Vomit Pants.
I thought it was Nuclear Chipmunk Pellets.
Well, it was yesterday, but today I feel Superpowered Vomit Pants is more the level of maturity I'm trying to go for.
Right.
I'm not all that interested.
Loud noise isn't really my idea of a good time.
Dex, it's not nice to call his music loud noise.
Well, actually, really loud noise is more accurate.
Look, you guys go have a good time.
I'll, I'll hook up with you later.
Bye, Sid.
Dex!
Come on, babe.
Let's go!
Come on!
Hey, forget him.
He's a little nerd boy.
Hey!
I've got only one question for you.
What's that?
Are you ready to rock?
Kind of?
Kind of?
Well, come on.
Did I buy bananas?
Escape!
I must come up with a cunning plan!
Cunning, cunning, cunning!
Hey, there, Saint Dickless.
I'm not dickless!
I am currently in possession of a dick.
Even though I don't use it much.
You foul beast of evil!
Let me out of these chains!
No.
You called me a foul beast of evil,
Come back here!
Come back here so that (?)
Ow, my arm.
There.
I escaped.
My cunning plan was a success.
I'm free.
Oh.
Hi.
Don't hurt me.
Look, you've been trying to kill me ever since I met you.
What is your problem?
Why do I have to have a problem with you?
I just don't like gorillas.
I've been studying gorillas all my life.
And all of them are evil.
Evil.
Evil.
Look.
Instead of trying to kill me, why don't you try and help me?
It's not like I wanna be a goddamn ape, all right?
You, you know how these, this shit, you went to Yale, right?
Actually, I did get my bachelor's degree at Yale in paranormal phenomena.
They have that at Yale?
Well, it was Yale...Community College.
Right.
Well, you still know more about this shit than I do.
What do I do?Inject me with shit?
Strap me to a table?
Anal probes?
What?
No, no, no.
Monkey man is fueled by hate and bourbon.
To destroy the evil of monkey man within you, you must destroy your anger management problem.
God, look!
I am so sick of hearing about this anger management crap.
I don't have any anger management  issues.
What is it with you people and your anger management bullshit.
Jesus Christ.
Where does this anger come from?
What are ya, playing Mr. Psychologist now?
Yes.
I did my master's degree in psychology.
They have a master's program at a community college?
No.
No, they don't.
Stop that.
Please, humor me.
My delusions keep me sane.
All right.
What do I have to do, some kind of touchy-feely, get to know my inner-self thing?
What?
Yes.
And I have just the thing.
Oh, it's so sad.
Oh, it's so sad.
Oh, I wish I had a vagina.
Look, this isn't working.
What?
You mean you don't cry either?
I don't get sad.
I only get pissed off.
When I spill my coffee, I get pissed off.
When my car breaks down, I get pissed off.
When my whole family died in a garbage compactor accident, I got really pissed off.
Our problem may stem from this.
Tell me about your mother.
Have you devised a plan to capture the battlesuit?
Well, sir, we've already discovered that any attack will be futile.
To get some ideas, we've been watching something humans call "movies".
Movies?
Yes, moving images that are a form of entertainment.
They are an invaluable source of information on humans act.
And we've discovered one method that always seems to work in situations like this.
What's that?
We have to kidnap his girlfriend!
Excellent.
Calm your spirit.
Clear your mind of all thoughts, especially ones of violence and anger.
Om.
Om....
Om.
You are not saying "Om" correctly.
Om.....
What do you want from your life?
What do I want from my life?
What a generic fucking question.
You know what I want in life?
I want some fucking closure for once, all right?
I mean, my, my, my family died in that trash compactor accident.
They never caught the garbage truck driver who did it.
Then they fired me at work.
They never told me why.
My girlfriend left me over the gorilla thing.
No, no.
Keep your eyes closed.
Keep meditating.
Oh, sorry.
Anyway, that's, I think that's where my problem comes from.
Just having so many of these inconclusive loose ends gnawing away at me.
A feeling of unresolution is like a weasel clenching your soul.
You must seek out that feeling through meditation.
Find the source of it, and release it.
Okay.
Here goes.
I see a river.
There are bears grazing in the distance.
I feel calm.
A sense of personal peace.
A pacification.
A sense of satisfaction flowing through me like water.
I feel...I feel enlightened.
I feel like there's this great weight that's been lifted off my soul.
I feel...ow, my god!
There's a fucking lamp on my head!
What?
What the fuck?
Don't destroy!
If you destroy--ow!
Everything we've learned will be wasted.
Mary have mercy.
I can't see shit through the--oh!
Jesus Christ!
Son of a bitch!
Ow!
So, where is the rest of your band?
Band?
Oh.
I only had a drummer, and he died.
It's okay.
With this guitar, I'll please any audience.
Hey!
Sid's here.
Sorry, babe.
This door's for performers only.
You'll have to go around to the front with the rest of the scum.
That's cool.
Uh, listen, I'm sure you'll rock.
Break an arm.
Don't you mean "break a leg"?
What?
Uh, hi, Julie.
I changed my mind.
One second.
We need to talk.
Hey!
What's with you trying to steal my girl?
She's not your girl.
She's not your girl, either.
Oh, Sid, ever since we were kids, you've been picking on me.
I'm not gonna put up with it anymore.
Fuck you.
It's fun to pick on you.
Oh, that's your solution to everything, isn't it?
"Fuck you."
Yeah.
Wait, where's Julie?
Well, that alien took her.
Didn't you see?
No, why didn't you try and stop him?
Stop who?
The alien!
I don't care.
Hey!
Where are you going?
We've tried everything.
I can't think of any way to cure you.
You're one pissed off little monkey.
A monkey.
A goddamn monkey.
I can think of only one final solution.
Hookers.
Hookers?
Hookers.
Hookers?
What should we do?
Top and bottom?
No, that's too predictable.
Hmm...tag-team!
Nah, not exciting enough.
How about (?) backwards strap-on sideways double-reverse?
But that defies the laws of gravity!
But I'm a bad girl.
I like to break the law.
What?
Oh, ohh!
I'm such a bad girl!
Oh, baby!
Uh-huh.
Ow, my groin!
Oh!
I think I'm fucking cured.
Hey!
Hey, where are you going?
To save Julie?
She's been kidnapped?
Who's Julie?
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Shoot the bastards, I guess.
Who is that?
I don't know.
Give up the battlepack, and we will return your girlfriend.
But she's not even his girlfriend.
In fact, last night we--
Silence!
Last night what?
I will turn her brain into mashed potatoes!
You will not!
I will, too!
Did he say mashed potatoes?
Hey, how do you turn a brain into a mashed potato?
If you could do that, you wouldn't need a battlesuit, would you, asshole?
Perhaps this shocking image will help change your mind.
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Okay, fine.
Just...you can have the battlepack.
Just please don't hurt her.
Excellent.
Okay, you have the battlepack, now bring Julie back.
Go fuck yourselves!
What a dickhead!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Attach the powerpack to our weapon systems.
With power like that, we can blast the shit out of this fucking planet.
No, hook the red one to the secondary hole--
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The blue one goes there, and the red one goes there.
Jesus, goddamit, no, no, no, no.
That one, okay, okay.
You kinda got it, now, now, the electrons will flow that way, they've gotta throw the positrons that way.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Now, okay, oh, you're getting, there, there ya go, you got it hooked up now.
Good work, guys.
That'll do it, that'll do it, you kids.
All right, now aim the blasters at the city, and blow the fuck outta their city!
You know, that really hit the spot.
That really, really hit the spot.
Hookers usually do.
That's why they're called hookers.
Wait, that doesn't make sense.
I think I just had a lot of sexual frustration pent up, you know?
The point is, I'm feeling perfectly calm right now.
I'm not angry at all.
Normally, your irritating voice would be driving me up the wall.
What?
I'm fine.
My voice isn't irritating.
You see?
I'm perfectly fine.
What?
You cured me, Jacob.
You son of a bitch.
What?
What?
Well, everything is just perfect now.
The aliens have my girlfriend, and my breakthrough scientific experiment, the most destructive weapon on the planet.
And you, you my friend, since we were kids, I build you a superguitar, apparently for free, I guess, and how do you repay me?
By trying to steal my girlfriend.
She's not even your girlfriend.
Shut up, Sid.
Oh, shut up, yourself, you wanker.
Maybe if you had the balls to tell her how you really felt, she would be your girlfriend.
Until then, I consider her fair game.
You know what, Sid, you're an asshole.
Oh, an asshole, really?
Hmm...gooooooooooooo fuck yourself.
What the hell was that?
It's that!
Oh, no.
They're gonna shoot lasers down on the city, aren't they?
Why do they gotta be so predictable?
Holy shit!
Come on, we've got to do something.
Let someone else do it.
Come on.
No!
You'r terrible beastform is all that can savae us now.
I don't have a gun, and we've got to save the city.
Use your monkey powers.
What monkey powers?
I don't know, throw feces at them.
Let the government deal with this, Jacob.
Come on.
Relax.
Have some fun.
I'm gonna get some more hookers, come on.
No more hookers!
You've had enough hookers!
Oh, shit.
There goes the planet.
Where's my jacket?
You took my jacket, you sonof a bitch!
The guns.
They've stopped!
Was that a Star Wars reference?
I don't think so.
What the fuck!
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
Uh.
Listen, I'm gonna go ahead and apologize for attacking your city.
It wasn't the brightest idea
I could give two flying fucks.
I could've really continued to lay waste to the entire planet with the power that battlepack complained.
Much kudos to you for inventing it.
Nice work, really.
It's a great scientific invention.
I would've thought of it myself, if I wasn't so stupid.
Well, thanks, I guess.
But what happened to it?
Did it break?
Well, not exactly.
Well, then what happened?
Yeah, why did you stop attacking?
Not that we wouldn't you to continue, or anything.
Well, um, someone kind of took the battlepack from us.
Someone who has a lot more to gain from its power source than we do.
Carrot Top?
Oh, god, no.
Then who?
Just tell us.
His name...is...Satan.
Oh...
Ugh...
Yeah.
I really hate to do this to you, and all, but we've gotta go.
This is a problem best left to your own Christian beliefs.
But I'm Jewish.
I'm agnostic.
I'm a Hindu.
I'm a democrat.
We're aliens.
We don't believe in God.
But I do believe in a god whose name is (?)
You know, god is much easier to say than (?)
What?
Look, whatever the fuck you are, we're leaving.
Hey, wait.
What?
What?
What happened to Julie.
Oh, Satan took her, too.
Ah, heck!
My girlfriend keeps getting kidnapped.
She's not your girlfriend, mate.
In fact, last night, me and her--
Shut up, Sid.
Oh, fuck off, you little ninny twit.
You're nothing but a little girly-man in glasses.
Why don't you stick a nuclear bomb up your nuclear ass?
Now, get out of here.
Sorry about all of this big mess and all, but go get that battlepack back, I guess.
If you get it, we'll steal it from you again.
What?
Fuck off.
Oh.
What is this?
What's going on?
Who's apartment are we in?
Who's that guy?
Who are you guys?
Go fuck yourself.
I wonder if that transporter beam will give us cancer.
Probably.
Does anybody else hear that music?
This music sucks.
Quiet, you fools.
Don't call me a fool.
I'm smarter than you are.
Jesus Christ!
Superstar!
That's right.
He looks shorter in person.
Dex, I know you meant well by creating the ultimate weapon of death, but mankind was never meant to interfere with subatomic particles.
That's strictly a God-only thing.
But God gave us minds with the ability to question and learn.
That's right.
And no one ever said what was and wasn't a God-only thing.
It's in the Bible.
No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.
Mmm, yes it is.
No, it isn't.
Hmm, I think it is.
But what are we to do, oh Lord?
Ray can no longer turn into a gorilla since he fucked those dirty whores.
Dex obviously doesn't have his spacesuit.
I'm a total pansy.
And the other guy doesn't even have his guitar.
What did you do with that guitar, by the way?
Oh, that.
I smashed it at me last show.
It was a blooming set, and I cropped the crikey on the stage!
You what?
That guitar cost $37,000!
I don't care how much it cost, mate.
The set was rocking.
Say, you think you can build me a new one?
...no?
Anyway, the point is, we can't save the world.
We suck.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
I hate all of you.
You may not have your weapons, but you can defeat him, by using your hearts and minds.
What?
What hearts?
What minds?
What the fuck are you talking about?
No weapons?
What the fuck are we supposed to use?
Curse words?
Don't swear at Jesus, Sid.
Just stop the Fallen Angel of Darkness, or humanity will perish.
I can grant you access to his lair, but I cannot help you.
It's too fucking hot.
All right, gentlemen.
Let's go home, and do this thing in the morning!
Yeah!
Oh, you mind if I squat here, mate?
I don't care, it's not my house.
Whoa!
Yep.
Finally in hell.
Why does it look like a cheesy special effect?
Holy shit!
What's that?
Silence!
Foolish humans!
Little did you know that you had unlocked the final mystery of the universe.
The key to infinite power!
The unlocking of the secret power of quarks!
What the fuck is a quark?
Soon I will destroy all of the world!
And hell will reign on earth!
It's so fucking hot in here.
I will destroy this world, and conquer it once and for all!
Won't conquering the erath be a moot point after you've destroyed it?
Ray, don't talk to the devil!
Shut up.
Julie!
Dex!
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?
Of course he hurt me, he's the devil.
All of, you just shut the fuck up.
This is terrible.
Oh, it's times like this I wish I were a real man.
Oh, you've got to do something.
Why me?
Because Dex is a little pussy, my gun doesn't work, and the other guy is totally useless.
Go fuck yourselfves.
Now, go fuck with yourself, you little hippie.
Fuck you.
Everybody knows that other guy is useless.
Well, you need one useless member in every superhero team.
I thought it was you, actually.
Is it me?
What?
We're a superhero team?
Yes.
God.
We're like the worst superhero team ever.
I don't even give a shit.
And I'm a total femme-man.
Oh, well.
Please, use your monkey powers to save the day!
I can't use my monkey powers anymore.
I'm too fucking calm.
Look.
We're in hell.
You know what they say.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
I've earned this spot.
I'm just gonna relax, and enjoy it as much as I can, Jacob.
Come on!
Turn into the ape, you (?)
Ow!
Don't hit me, you homosexual!
Ow!
Fuck you!
Screw you, Satan!
Stop being a bitch!
Give me back that battlepack, or I'll...
You'll what?
I'll...I'll...fuck you, dad!
I mean, Satan!
Ow, that did not hurt.
Nobody ever hits me like that, Jacob.
Well, I did.
Don't you ever hit me like that again.
Why not?
Cuz I don't like it when people hit me.
I don't like it when people hit me, either.
Maybe I should.
Should what?
Hit you again, just to show you whwat it's like, you stupid piece of shit.
If you hit me...
If I hit you, what?
Do you two ninnies call this an argument?
What the fuck do you want, Sid?
I'm here to show you what an argument is.
It's getting a bit fucking hot in here, ain't it?
You suck as well.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
What the fuck is your problem?
Hey, I'm right here.
Fuck both of you!
Oh, no one cares about you, you're just a moron.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Why don't you fuck yourself?
Fuck you.
Oh, go fuck yourself, asshole.
Fuck you.
"I'm Mr. (?)"
"I'm a punk rocker!"
You're about as bright as a 2-watt bulb!
Go eat another manwich, you queer punk.
Who put the fucking (?) up your ass?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Fuck you, you dumb shit.
I hope you all get hit by cars.
Many cars, from many different directions!
I'm gonna rape every last member of your family while wiping their shit on the walls!
Fuckers!
You're a dumb asshole!
Would you stop hitting me with your pen, you moron?
I hate you!
I hate your guts!
Look at you, you dumb assholes, with your green hair, running around playing your guitar on your stupid two-man band.
You think you're ever gonna go anywhere in life, you son of a bitch!
God, I can't stand being stuck in hell with you two!
I hate everything!
I feel nothing but pain here!
This is hell, and I can't stand you motherfuckers!
Fuck you!
Fuck everything!
I just don't care anymore!
And the whole world can go to hell!
Holy shit!
Monkey man's going to fight Satan!
Aughhh!
Look at that cosmic clash of the titans!
Foolish humans.
You thought you could stop me with your pathetic monkey powers?
I am Satan!
I am the ultimate badass.
Julie!
Yes, Dex?
Since we're both probably gonna die and be tortured forever, I just wanted to say that...that I love you.
Dex, I love you, too.
I've always loved you.
Oh, fuck.
Aughhhhhh!
That's so fucking stupid!
Ow, my brain!
Let's get the hell out of here.
What about all the millions of tortured souls?
Fuck them, let's go!
Ow, my fucking brain!
The rarest find of all!
Now, stay still.
This may hurt a lot.
Ow, my glasses!
We're here!
Where are we?
We did it!
We destroyed hell!
But, where will all the murderers and rapists, go?
Well, I don't know about the murderers and rapists, but the whores can come to my place.
Oh, those whacky, whacky whores.
Say, everybody.
I think I hit me head.
Where did hell go?
What happened?
You buffoon!
When Dex proclaimed his love for Julie, deep in the bowels of hell, he defeated Satan with the greatest superpower of all.
True love.
I feel like singing.
That's so stupid.
And cliched.
Fuck you, and fuck this.
I'm going to start me punk band.
I should leave as well.
I've got a trophy to mount.
Good luck, you two.
And I've got you.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Julie.
I know things have been weird, but everything's gonna be all right now.
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
Was that a Fight Club reference.
I don't think so?
