Okay, everyone.
The pig is in the poke.
Excellent.
The mission is going according to plan.
Isn’t all this a bit obvious?
No.
Their primitive backwards culture won’t understand what’s going on … until it’s too late.
Dr. Sunkyst.
Are you sure you’re up to this?
You are very very old.
Oh no.
This sort of thing is old hat to an action scientist.
Besides, I need to deactivate the device personally.
Understood.
Let’s move out, people.
Since the international community will not listen to my demands, this will be the fate of all of you.
Kill the first hostage.
Huh?
Wait, wait.
What?
Ready.
Aim.
Wait.
Don’t I get any last words?
Oh, oh.
Uhm, okay, I guess.
Let him have his last words.
No matter how hard you try to destroy freedom, no matter how evil your plans may be and how you stop at nothing to enslave and murder people, just remember these words: we will always
I love doing that.
Funny every time.
Stop it.
Stop fighting you two.
Be serious.
What do you think it is?
I don’t know.
Maybe a gift from the gods?
Doubtful.
It’s probably another bomb…
Sir.
Oranges are attacking.
What?
Kill them all.
What is it?
Don’t tell me you didn’t debrief him.
There wasn’t time.
It’s an invention of mine.
It sends out electrical impulses and alters brainwaves.
A brainwashing machine?
More or less.
It can make our terrorist friends happy as clowns.
Unfortunately, the device has a very short range.
In order for it to work, we’ll have to sneak it right next to that compound.
Now, the hostages are being held in the former “Family Fun Activity Center.” It’s been converted into a place to hold public executions.
Dschihad!
Dschihad!
Oh my!
Ah, they’re breaking in!
Private!
Hold on.
We’ll get you out of there.
Commander, what are you doing?
We have to move.
Leave that man behind.
If we don’t move now, we’ll be overwhelmed.
I won’t leave any man behind.
I’ve seen this happen a dozen times in WWII.
That man has no hope.
Our mission it’s what is important now.
We have to go.
I’m not going to give that order, doctor.
Then I will.
Move out.
That’s an order, commander.
We’re going to leave that man to die in order to save our president or someone.
I (?) the debriefing either.
Just remember one thing.
I’m in charge here, not you.
You’re just a scientist now.
Back in World War II one of my men was slightly injured at the toe and we left him behind in order to press on.
And you know what?
We killed Hitler on that mission.
So don’t give me any of this poppycock.
Times have changed.
We no longer accept casualties like…
Oh my!
Now it’s all up to me.
Eat this!
Hurry up!
Fix this tank!
We must keep killing!
How do I get myself into these situations?
Whoa!
Whoa!
How on earth did I get here?
Now’s my chance.
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where I’m at?
They’re getting to close.
Kill the president.
Take this.
I’m going to send your brains to the wash.
Well, Osana.
I can’t say it hasn’t been a blast.
Literally.
But me and my hostages have to keep going now.
Oh no, no, stay, stay and have some of my yumhuckamas (?) My slave just baked some.
No, these, these nice folks need to get back with their families and loved ones.
Okay then.
Thanks for everything.
Toodle-oo.
I’m sure you’ll be hearing from us very shortly.
Those oranges.
Such nice folks.
Cheerio!
Bye!
And tomorrow marks the day notorious criminal and murderer Dr. Eggplant will be executed in Orange County prison.
This execution, which has been delayed numerous times, due to constant Banana appeals, will mark a closure for the family of famed OSUD (?), who was brutally murdered by Dr. Eggplant.
And in other news, famed science adventurer Charles Sunkyst has rescued the president from terrorists in Bananastan.
Beautiful salad.
Look at you, moisten.
Dean Crispus.
You’re a vegetarian.
Promise you won’t tell my wife.
I promise.
What can I do for you, Charles?
I’m back from my science adventure in the Middle East.
How did it go?
You could say it was a smashing success.
Hahaha.
Yes.
An explosive good time?
No.
Hello, class.
I have returned.
I hope you didn’t give the substitutes any trouble while I was gone.
Oh, hello, are you a new student?
Uhm, hi, yeah, I just transfered here from Arthur Apple Academy.
Oh, I’m sorry.
Apple-American studies is in room 213.
This is Advanced Particle Physics, you know.
Uhm, yeah?
I know.
Just wondering if you can handle the material.
I can’t believe that old peel.
Well, now that I’ve confused you just enough to ruin your weekends, we’ll call it a day.
Class dismissed.
Excuse me.
Professor Sunkyst?
Oh yes.
Jessica, wasn’t it?
Yes, that’s right.
I was wondering if I could get some extra tutoring on some of this material, especially the subjects pertaining to using refracted light energy to dangerous laser beams.
Yes, I’d love to talk about it some more.
I’m available every night in my office after 6 p.m.
Nevermind.
Nights are bad for me.
I’m very busy at nights.
I gotta go.
Dude.
Got the kegs and the weed.
We’re set once again for another memorable weekend.
Yeah, I don’t know.
What’s the deal?
Still waiting on your liver transplant?
No, I got that put in last week.
It’s just all we do every weekend is drink beer.
I was thinking maybe we could do something different.
What?
Like, check out the zoo downtown.
Ha!
Nice joke.
No, man.
They got a lot of far out animals there I’d like to see.
Let’s just get drunk, stupid.
Yeah, I guess, it was a stupid idea.
Hello, boys.
Hello, there.
Don’t think I’ve seen you around.
I’m new.
I came here from a foreign country.
I was wondering if maybe you could show me around campus.
Oh hell, yeah!
I love to.
Perhaps you can start by showing me your bedroom.
Uh, yeah!
Come here, big boy.
Kiss me a big sexy kiss.
Booya!
Hahahaha!
My experiment is a success!
A robot.
She’s a robot doll!
What?
You apple.
Hey!
What’s going on here?
Sir.
Is this apple giving you trouble?
Yeah.
His stupid robot just kissed me.
You idiot.
Apples aren’t smart enough to build robots.
I’ll get you for that one, apple.
It’s time, Mr. Eggplant.
I will begin praying your last rites.
We got an eggplant walking.
We got an eggplant walking.
Mr. Eggplant.
You have been sentenced to die by electrocution.
Your crimes have been most appalling.
Ever since you murdererd the dean, your life has been nothing but a downward spiral of violence and hate.
To be rid of you, quite frankly, will make the world better off.
Have you any last words?
Very well.
Father?
May God have mercy on your soul.
Fry the bastard.
What?
What?
What’s going on?
Someone tell me what’s going on.
Sound off the alarms.
He’s build a robotic duplicate of himself.
That’s an electric conductor.
Oh no, the power grid.
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me?
Hello?
I drank too much.
What?
I’m your next door neighbor and I have some complaints.
Dude.
Erik.
Your dad’s here.
Huh?
No.
I’m not your father.
Och, thank God.
I can’t stand the stench around here.
When was the last time you cleaned up?
Where’s your maid?
What do you want?
Well, for starters, a cure for the cancer that’s slowly eating my head.
But I’ll settle if you’re cleaning up all of your garbage.
Huh?
Your mountain of garbage has finally spilled over into my petunia bed.
I’d like to speak to somebody about this.
Garbage.
Okay.
Whatever
I expect it to be cleaned up tomorrow.
Or else.
Cheerio.
Hey.
Wait.
Aren’t you one of my Professors?
Yes, I thought I smell something familiar.
I think I’m in your Advanced Particle Physics class.
Hm, yes.
I fear for our future generations.
Oh my God, I escaped.
They’re all around me.
What’s in that window?
I don’t know, I’ll look.
Looks clear, looks clear.
Keep moving.
Let’s go, let’s go.
Come on, (?) down that alley.
Time to pay a little visit to Charles Sunkyst.
This is indeed horrid news, Agent Orange.
A saboteur, you say?
Yes, and we’ve just gotten word that millions of dollars worth a dangerous scientific equipment has gone missing from a laboratory in the squash valley.
My word.
We were able to track the equipment to somewhere on the OSU campus, but no one admits to having seen anything.
And that’s not all.
Don’t tell me.
Disco’s back?
No.
Much worse.
The military reports that its new water melon class supertank has gone missing from a base just one mile from here.
Missing?
How do you misplace a supertank?
It’s not like your wallet.
Or keys.
Or your wife.
They’re not sure.
But we do know this: we suspect someone might be planning a terrorist attack on Orange university.
It’s a good thing we’ve got our best action scientist there, keeping his eyes peeled.
Oh, who’s that?
His name is Ringo Rumplerant and he’s the best we got.
I’m sorry.
He retired years ago.
Oh.
Well, I guess we have to rely on you then.
Have you noticed anything suspicious?
Well, there is a new student who did just transfer into one of my classes, some… apple.
Oh my.
Are you a fruitist, Professor?
The heavens know, that mere notion of that is absurd.
Tea, massah?
She’s my maid.
Hey!
Professor Sunkyst!
Oh my, it’s you.
You’re not going to rob you, aren’t you?
Er, no.
Why would I rob you?
Well, nevermind.
I just wanted to say, I think somehow you got a bad first impression of me yesterday in class, you know.
You know, I really am a hardworking student.
So tell me, uhm…
Jerome.
Ah, Jerome.
So, Jerome, what exactly did you study at Arthur Apple Academy?
robotics, engineering and quantum physics.
So that’s what they’re calling basketball these days.
What?
Anyway.
I think you’re going to be really impressed with my science project.
What is it?
An affirmative action rape?
No.
It’s a secret.
Right.
A secret.
A big secret.
A big dangerous explosive secret.
So in the event one wishes to commit an act of terrorism against a major university, what would be the best way to go about this by using a water melon class supertank and millions of dollars worth of dangerous stolen scientific equipment?
Anyone?
I’ll give out an A for the semester for anybody who knows the correct answer.
Jessica.
Wake up, dear.
Yes?
Sorry.
I had a long night last night.
Ah yes.
Working on your science project, no doubtß
Yeah.
Science project, that’s right.
I’ve really… working on that.
Would you be so kind as to share with the class what your science project is?
Well, it’s still in the design phase, so I’ll keep it to myself for now.
Right.
A secret.
A big secret.
A big dangerous explosive secret.
You want to perform a science experiment on me?
Like, in my hotel room?
No, no.
I want you to sabotage a science experiment.
I’m sorry, that’s just too weird, even for a deceased crack whore like myself.
Dude.
I got the stuff.
All I need from you is the cash and to keep your mouth shut.
No problem, man.
Good evening.
How am I supposed to sleep with all this broccoli.
Hello, everyone.
We’re Dumpster Breath and we’re here to rock your socks off.
How are everyone, come on.
Here we go.
One, a two, a one, two, three, four.
Hey, George, grab me smokes from me car.
Hey, baby, what’s up?
What’s going on?
This is preposterous.
Oh my, is that smoke?
They’re smoking and drinking beer too.
This is hedonistic.
Excuse me.
I’m trying to get some sleep here.
I kindly ask all of you to keep the noise down to a minimum.
I like your style, dude.
I’d be more than down to help you out.
That apple made a fool of me.
Excellent.
This sabotage will be quite simple, really.
Right, man.
500 bucks is great and all, but I can’t get caught.
I’d have to go back and live with my parents.
I’m not paying you, because sabotaging a robot is complicated.
I’m paying you, because I can’t riskt getting caught.
But what’s the point of all this?
The point?
This school and that unfair science fair will pay for what they’ve done to me.
How they ruined my life.
How they made me into the monster, that I am today.
I will make them pay.
I will make Charles pay.
Yeah, but…
Look, do you want the money or not, hippie?
Yeah.
Dude.
Okay, I’m done.
Jerome.
Working a little late, are we?
No one to see what you’re working on all alone in the dark.
I don’t know, what your problem with me is, but ever since I came to this school, you’ve been on my case.
I just like to keep close ties with my students, that’s all.
Well, maybe you should back off, because someone like me has to work twice as hard to get ahead, especially with fruitist jerks like you around.
I see.
And would that make you angry?
A little, yeah.
I’ve had some hard times in my life, dealing with people like you, but I’ll always come out on top one way or another.
I see.
Ooh, my brain and my stomach.
I feel terrible.
Erik.
Erik.
Oh my.
Have you cleaned my backyard, yet?
Huh?
My petunias.
They were covered in your garbage.
Have you cleaned it up?
Where am I?
There she is.
(?) sleeps in class.
Let’s see what’s she been up to at night.
(?) Just an anonymous pervert, sneaking through the pervert room.
Sorry, young lady.
Can I pick that up for you?
Get out of my way!
Hey, old dude.
Over here.
Hello there.
I was just using the payphone and and needed a…
No, that’s cool, Professor.
We won’t say anything.
Dude, man.
We all like a little hot peel action every now and then.
Oh my.
Are you okay?
You almost fell out of your chair.
I just saw a nude woman.
Hey, sweet thing.
There she is.
Can I get a private dance?
Sure, baby.
If you excuse me, gentlemen, I have to use the restroom.
Hey, come on, open the door.
Just a minute.
Don’t rush me.
Hach, we got another kiwi stuck in the toilet again.
I hate my life.
You’re a hot little piece of rind, do you know that?
Jessica?
Are you here?
Aah, come on over here.
I want you to put your junk on me.
Hello.
Jessica?
Are you here?
Yeah.
You like that, big boy?
Bet you wish you could see my juicy inside.
What do you think you’re doing?
Giving you a private performance?
You know, what I came back here for.
Jessica?
Jessica?
You must be the new dancer.
You’re late.
Oh my.
No, I, no, I, actually I’m…
You got a strange voice, but all you have to do is show your tits and do a few tricks on your pole.
You don’t understand.
But, but…
No.
I won’t listen.
Get on out there.
Come on, honey!
Get on out there and show ’em what the seed gave you.
Oh, this is just like a sitcom.
Come on, just give me what I want.
I’ve got money.
Ladies and gentlemen, I mean, just gentlemen, direct your attention to the stage.
Our newest dancer, Juicy, is about to perform for your mastubatory pleasure.
I can’t believe your even suggesting this.
This is not a brothel.
You could have fooled me.
Get out.
Get out of here.
If you don’t get me what I want, I’m gonna take it wether you like it or not.
No!
No,no, you don’t understand.
It’s not what it looks like.
I was really just backstage trying to find one of the strippers.
This is so embarrassing.
You try standing up here in a fruit hat and then, then we’ll see if I laugh at you.
How do you think this is funny, don’t you?
Oh yeah!
Take it off, old dude.
I was trying to help someone.
This heavy fruit hat is twisting my spinel
I’m going to sue all of you.
Blasted comedy hijinks.
See?
I did change your mind.
Now I’m gonna get what I want wether you like it or not.
Batter up.
What?
Looks like it’s lights out for him.
Hahaha, I just so love my wit.
What?
What’s going on?
Jessica.
Wait.
Jessica.
What are you doing here?
I, I, I wanted to see what science project you were working on, with your experiment sexual in nature perhaps.
I’m not working on a project.
I don’t have time.
I have to strip at night to pay for school.
Oh, yes, yes, I see that now and much more than I wanted to and so did the audience.
Leave me alone.
No, stop!
Don’t run away.
Hm, I wonder when last call is.
Okay, class, so if you’d read your chapter on superconductors, you’d know that… what?
What was that?
Hello?
Did anyone else see that?
He?
So anyway, on the chalkboard here I’m going to draw a diagram of a super conductor and then piece by piece we’re going to go through all the parts and I’d like you, the students, to name them for me to prove that you’ve… what the...
What?
Who’s...?
What the...
Anyway...to prove that you’ve read the chapter and uh...what?
Hello?
Hello?
Excuse me a minute.
Dean!
Dean!
Call the FBI.
I’ve figured out who it is.
I just saw a dirty eggplant, uh….
You were saying?
Charles.
What are you talking about?
I like to introduce you to Professors Boushneu and McConnal, who will be judging the science fair.
Oh, I see.
And him?`
This is Mr. Oggplint.
He’s from the National Science Review.
They want to do a big story on this year’s science fair.
Oh, they do?
They do?
Yes.
I have a feeling that the Orange university science fair will make big headlines this year.
We do have the best and the brightest students in the nation.
Yes.
It’s a great honor to cover this story.
And if I could also get an interview with the great Professor Sunkyst, that would be awesome.
I wouldn’t quite know how to tank you, I mean, thank you.
I’m sorry.
Did you just say tank?
No.
But remember, Charles, we’re going to have some top guests.
So it’s very important nothing goes horribly wrong.
No.
No one would want that.
Wouldn’t they?
Ow, my face.
Oh, I’m terribly sorry.
I accidentally pushed this box of medical waste right in front of you.
What’s stuck in me?
What is this stuck in… oh my God.
Here, let me help you clean that right up.
I happen to have a handkerchief right here.
I’m terribly sorry.
Oh, uhm, err, it’s all right.
I’ll live, I think.
I’m so sorry, mister Oggplant, was it?
Yes.
It was Mr. Oggplint.
(?) you remember.
I would have asked you if we’ve met before.
You look very familiar.
I’m sure we’ve been to some sort of scientific function together.
I mean, it’s hard not to run into the famous, successful, perfect, intelligent, adventurous, loved, admired, well-rounded, charming, debonair, classy Professor Sunkyst.
Yes, I, I suppose that’s true.
Well, good day to you, I’ve got some affairs to attend to.
Excuse me.
Jessica.
Jessica.
Wait up.
I’d like to talk to you.
Hi.
Listen.
I’m sorry about the way I acted.
You were very heroic to help me.
I was just kinda, you know?
No, don’t worry about it.
I’d like to talk to you about a science fair project.
Make it “messes that I got to clean up.”
I know I probably shouldn’t have told you all that sensitive, top secret FBI information, but I’ve been looking back at your test scores and you show a lot of potential.
I think I can trust you.
I still don’t understand what it is we’re building and… why.
It’s an electromagnetic dampening field generator powered by inverting polaron radiation.
I don’t understand what any of that means.
But… it’s, well, but it’s pretty simple.
According to your test scores you should…
Ooh.
I cheated on those tests.
Oh, that’s fine.
I just needed someone to enter this in the fair, so that it’s nearby and will serve as a weapon against the eggplant in case he tries anything.
Okay, that’s cool, I guess.
Hey yo.
Hook up with any robots lately?
Watch your back, apple.
Man, why don’t you just forget about it?
I’m not stressing.
Don’t worry, he’ll get what’s coming at him.
I’ve been thinking.
I should probably stop drinking and concentrate more on my score.
I made a project for the science fair.
You wanna go with me?
Already in, dude.
You’re going to the science fair?
What do you know about experimenting?
No.
No.
That’s experimenting with drugs.
Ooh.
Well, either way it’ll be a trip.
Alright, let’s go to the science fair.
Professor?
Oh yes, Erik?
I have a project I like to enter.
But it’s a little late, Erik, I didn’t even know you were working on one.
Yeah, I wipped it up last night.
Well, I’m sure it will be impressive.
Uhm, put it in front of the others, we’ll get it out of the way first.
Charles, over here.
Oh yes, dean.
I’m coming right away, dean.
See you later, Erik.
That old dude is such a tool.
Hey, stoner.
Are you ready?
Am I?
Oh yeah, dean.
I forgot to mention the FBI contacted me.
They said someone had stolen a massive (?) and taken some dangerous scientific equipment and is somewhere on campus.
They think they’re planning to blow up the school.
What?
Why didn’t you tell me?
Oh, I worked so hard on that.
Hey!
Dean Snaboswki.
Ambassador Block.
Welcome to our science fair.
Yes, that certainly is cute.
Nothing like a science fair at Princeton, though.
I’m sure you’ll find the project, our students have come up with, to be some of the most innovative.
Yes, yes, well, let’s excuse Charles.
I’m sure he’s got a lot of things he needs to be taking care of.
Activate.
Good afternoon, master.
Hey, girl.
Well, here’s our big chance.
Time to show all these oranges that the next great mind in cybernetics is going to be an apple from the ghetto.
And you know, I’ve worked real hard on you, so I’m glad you didn’t trip on me.
I will perform to the best of my ability, master.
I will not let you down.
Well, I gotta go.
Remember to wait for my signal.
Yes, master.
This isn’t actual anthrax, is it?
Oh, yes.
Very deadly.
Well, just make sure it doesn’t blow around the room or anything like that.
Ah, a tornado simulator.
How interesting.
Identify yourselves.
What are you gonna do?
Gonna do what I do with all chicks, Erik.
Get ‘em drunk, dude.
Lite makes plants grow.
Yes.
Yes, it does.
This is a violation.
You are violating me.
How many times have I heard that.
A vase?
A 12th century Ming vase.
You see my major is archaeological science.
I painstakingly restored this vase to its original beauty from tiny, tiny fragments and mere dust particles, using a high-powered microscope and fractal lasers.
I pulled up the pieces in places via a computer program that I designed.
There were over 955.000 individual fragments, all of which were painstakingly catalogued and I reassembled the vase then, based on original drawings and pictures, specifications.
It took over 19 months to do.
Yea, I do puzzles, too.
Carry on.
And what have we here?
These are the ceremonial masks of the Southwest Avocados.
They had use theses masks during tribal rituals.
The Avocados would often wear masks.
They’d use them for many different functions.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Oh yes.
This will work perfectly.
Ahhh!
Allah will be proud of our sacrifice.
He’s going to blow up the science fair with the towel head.
Yes.
Just leave it right here on the table.
You are very gracious for attending my (?) drive.
Thank you very much.
It’s a pleasure to serve the community.
Gee, I hope the professor likes my project.
I am not doing very well in his class.
Hey.
Do you wanna leave?
I do what I came to do.
But the fair hasn’t even started yet.
Good afternoon and welcome to the 66st annual Orange university science fair.
As the coordinator of this event I’m happy to see such a large turnout, especially since the big football game is going on.
So let’s all cheer on our home team.
Through science!
Anyway.
I’d like to introduce you to our panel of judges.
First is professor Boushneu, doctor of physical studies at the university of Ush-hush(?).
Yes, I’m glad I could fit this into my very busy schedule.
Then there’s Dr. G McConnal, head of the physics department at Cornell university.
Thank you.
And then some lousy eggplant, I mean, Dr. Oggplint.
Dr. Oggplint, everybody heard me say Oggplint, not lousy Eggplant, which means kind of a racial slur, but Dr. Oggplint.
Now let’s take a look what all this promising young scientific minds have to offer.
Our first project is a, a, oh, uhm…
Hi everyone.
Uhm, this is my project.
I made it last night.
Uh.
Charles.
I don’t remember them being on the list.
Who are they?
They could be the ones you’re looking for.
No, no.
It’s, it‘s just Erik.
He’s just some imbecile student of mine.
Is there a problem?
Uhm, Erik…
I’d like to see their experiment.
Oh, no, no problem.
It’s probably just a volcano or something.
Hurry up, Erik.
It’s a volcano.
Och, wonderful.
F.
Oh my.
Oh no, it’s going off.
It wasn’t supposed to go off yet.
No, no, my (?) got liquid on it.
Oh dear.
F, F, F, F, F+.
Oh no.
F-.
Oh no, Erik.
Your shoddily made volcano is causing a chain reaction, which is destroying the science fair.
Hey, what’s going on in the room next door?
What?
Hey, are you okay?
Fine.
No man, it doesn’t look like you’re fine.
You’ve got anthrax all over you or something.
Aaaah.
Ow.
What, am I being pollinated?
Everyone run, everyone get out.
Erik has destroyed the science fair.
I’m supposed to ruin the science fair.
Charles, how could you let some imbecile enter a bubbling volcano into the science fair and then put it next to a power reactor?
I’m very offended, anarchy (?) is unacceptable.
I am outraged.
Who allowed their students to enter that (?)
Erik is a student of mine.
I’m sure he has something to do with this.
Blaming the judges makes you just look more guilty for your incompetence.
The entire scientific community will hear of your failure, professor Sunkyst.
Aha!
What?
I thought, I’d recognize you.
What?
What’s everybody looking at?
What?
Oh.
Oh my god, my disguise.
Stop him!
Somebody get that dirty eggplant.
He’s here to kill us all.
What?
What the hell is that?
It’s a filthy apple hooker and she’s probably looking for crack.
No!
It’s my science project.
That’s your project?
I think something is wrong with it.
Seriously wrong.
Worst science fair ever.
Ooh, aah, the agony.
Apparently I’m doomed.
Tell Martha, I hid her savings in the öh,öh, argh.
I knew it.
You’re in cahoots with that filthy eggplant.
What, what?
What are you talking about?
Oh my.
You planned to destroy the science fair and the school.
I should have known, it would have been an apple.
What?
Man, you’re nothing but a fruitist.
An old, charred up, brown fruitist.
I resent that.
I’m not brown.
I’m orange, tried and true.
You’re brown.
Brown and little, like a kiwi.
And you didn’t even deny you’re a fruitist.
I deny it.
I do deny it.
My maid is an apple.
Stop fighting you two.
You’re right.
Oh my.
Hey Mack.
We gotta get outta here.
I gotta watch my vase.
Forget it, man.
Come on.
I want to watch my vase.
Let me stay.
Ow.
Oh my god.
Woman!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Oh, get off of me.
Bring it.
Ooh.
Ooh, my goodness.
My hair is on fire.
Someone fetch me a pail of water.
Ooh, my goodness, oh, ooh.
Wooh, waah, wooh, my goodness.
Ow, my face.
Jerome, how do we stop it?
I have no idea.
I didn’t put no laser gun in it.
Professor.
You’re, I mean, my science project.
Didn’t you, I mean, I make it to stop the eggplant?
Oh yes.
I almost forgot.
Come on.
But we’ll need some cover.
Ow my eye.
I need you to distract the laser beams.
Don’t move.
Almost there.
Shut up.
We have to be quiet.
We’re almost there.
The machines’s right across that table.
Keep moving towards it.
Don’t stop.
Oh my.
Jerome.
We’re pinned down.
It knows we’re here.
Do something.
Sally.
Whoa, whoa.
It’s me.
It’s master.
Quickly.
That’s our cue.
Let’s go.
What’s wrong with you?
Why are you killing?
I was told to.
He made me do it.
What?
Who did?
Tell me his name.
It was the eggplant.
It matters not.
You’re not in control of me anymore, the alcohol is.
I won’t comply.
That’s it, Jessica.
I let you hit the button.
Zombies!
Run!
Aah.
Professor?
Yes?
When the eggplant’s mustache fell off, you said you recognized him.
From where?
It was a long time ago and a long story.
Well, we got plenty of time.
Very well.
The year was 1935 and we were in the middle of the great depression.
So, since times were rough my science experiment was a machine that could print money.
But at that time I was naive and was using something called hemp to print the bills on.
Any bills that were printed incorrectly or offset, I tossed into a giant fire as to keep my counterfeit operation legal.
So after a while I began to feel a little bit funny.
It was still early in the automobile revolution, but Eggplant had invented the first electric car engine and adopted it to an old Model-T.
I would have revolutionized the world.
Unaware of my altered mental state, I wheeled my project off to the great science fair.
People were expecting me to be happy about the science fair, but this was a little too happy.
Hello, Charles.
Take off, my project, makes money.
I’m gonna be rich.
Eh-hi hi.Hi.
Apparently, I had arrived very late and it was just before Eggplant was to reveal his project.
Charles, what are you doing here?
30 seconds Mr. Eggplant.
Are you ready?
Yes, I’m ready.
Ready as ever.
Ready to change the world.
What are you doing, man?
Is that a car?
This science fellow be the best yet.
That’s very true, sir.
What’s wrong?
I do enjoy sipping brandy.
What?
Pre-fair entertainment?
This should be good.
This is incredibly offensive.
What’s the deal?
Oh, it’s unplugged.
How awful.
5 seconds.
Sickening.
Could this get any worse?
Just charge that up real quick here.
Oh, oh, it’s in ‘drive’.
What?
No.
Aah.
Oh my.
What have I done?
What has Charles done?
The ruling was not kind.
It is the determination of this court that you be sentenced to death for brutally murdering the dean.
I didn’t murder anyone.
My project landed on him, It was an accident.
Murderer!
Send him to the chair for murdering the dean.
Settle down.
Quiet!
Mister murderer, I mean, Eggplant, what is your defence?
My defence is that it was Charles Sunkyst’s carelessness that caused this accident.
Oh that Mr. Weatherbeam.
Ahem, ahem.
Charles.
Oh, I’m sorry.
Where am I again?
Oh, the trial, right, I’m sorry.
What have you to say?
Oh yes.
May I get some water, please?
Oh yes, certainly.
Someone get Charles some water.
See, Charles Sunkyst is an upstanding young fruit.
He would never be careless.
How dare you even suggest it?
It is the determination of this court that you be executed to death.
Well, that’s what happened.
If I were him, I’d wanna kill you, too.
But you see, none of this is really my fault.
Who cares?
Let’s just find a way out of here.
That would be wise.
Hey look, there’s a map.
Let’s take a look at it and see if there’s a way out of here.
Hmm, this map is old.
Hey.
Let’s leave.
What?
No, I think we should stay here.
Come on.
Let’s lose these science nerds.
We’d be better off on our own.
No.
You can do what you wanna do, but I’m staying.
Fine.
That’s the way you want it, dude.
Ow!
Whoa!
Son!
Put the gun down!
Put the gun down, you stupid hippie!
You’re making a big mistake!
Get over there, stupid!
Are you crazy?
You should have listened to me.
Jake, listen to reason.
I’m a lot smarter than you are and I know that gun is a bad idea.
Stay back!
Son, I know you’re feeling trapped, but there is a way out.
No, man!
Those zombies are gone.
Listen!
Don’t open that door!
Stay back!
I’m leaving.
See.
Everything’s cool.
Aaah, aaah, not my (?), dude!
Aaah, aaah, my groin!
?
I hope you were reading that map.
I was.
Follow me!
This way everyone!
Jerome!
Professor, what happened?
Oh no, it’s Jerome.
I’m afraid he has fallen through the ceiling tile down into the room below.
Jerome.
Hold on.
Hey man, can you help me out?
Aaah!
Holy crap, there’s zombies everywhere!
We’ve got to keep moving.
Leave him behind.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Weighing the options.
Hey, not below the stain(?)!
What’s to think about?
Keep moving this is war.
Professor!
Help!
No, it isn’t.
But Jerome, he’s in danger.
Your little friend matters not.
He’s a fatality.
You go down there you lose precious time and maybe your life.
Besides, he’s just an apple.
What about you?
Don’t you say anything?
Mmm, pastries.
Get lost, both of you.
I must do the right thing.
Well, since I know everything, I must know something about zombies.
The year was 1982 and while trying to resurrect my dead wife, I accidentally created a zombie plague.
In my experiments I discovered one odd thing…
That’s the phone, Bob.
It’s your aunt, Felicia.
… zombies have a strange compulsion to answer the telephone.
Do either of you two have a cell phone?
JESSICA, Of course!
Good.
Get ready to dial the number of that pay phone, when I tell it to you.
Hold on, Jerome!
Here I come!
Die, again!
Okay, the number is 5555555.
My dang battery is dead.
God.
555-5 what?
It’s all fives.
The number is all fives!
Okay.
Jerome.
Press yourself against the tables.
The zombies are coming, we can’t let them through.
Push, push harder.
What’s going on up there, guys?
Nothing’s happening.
What did you dial?
5 fives.
No, you need 7.
I need a 7?
No, no 7, it’s just fives!
You better hurry!
Push, push harder!
What is the 7 go?
Just let me do it.
Hold them back.
Hold them back a little further.
Oh, push them, oh no, they’re getting through.
Hit them, hit them with that chair!
You didn’t say 7.
What’s going on up there?
We could use a little bit of help.
Hold on a second.
Oh, ow!
555-5557.
Wait!
The area code!
You’ll need the area code.
The area code is 555, so dial 555-5555555.
What?
No, you need 7, arh, fives.
There is no sevens.
Jessica is having a problem with her hair.
Everything’s under control.
So another 5 in front of all the other fives, right?
Hurry!
You need to put the (?) in front of it.
What the hell is the problem?
What?
Hold on, Jerome.
Keep those zombies at bay for just a little bit longer.
Ow!
I’m too young to die!
I feel like I’m back at this jerk (?)
Push!
Hold them back.
Oh, these things are disgusting.
Hold, wait, how many?
Hello.
What?
Marge, I think I got a wrong number!
Strange men are moaning on Mapleton.
Where do you think you’re going?
Now’s our chance, Jerome.
Let’s go get that eggplant!
Take that!
Die!
Take this!
Oh my!
Help!
Help!
Aah, aah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
How on earth did I get here?
Oh no, you don’t.
Holy crap!
That’s a nice piece of equipment.
I will no longer tolerate this.
You students stay here.
Whoa, William, you are one lucky guy!
You’re… tell-ing me?
Hello, Orange university.
Oh my, what have I gotten myself into?
Oh, come on now.
The one you should be booing is Charles Sunkyst.
His antics ruined my life.
And now I will have my revenge.
Don’t listen to him.
Only most of what he said is true.
You must pardon all the carnage, Charles, but I have lived a miserable life and I attribute it all to you.
Now, without further ado, I will fire my doom cannon into the school, totally destroying it.
Wait!
Don’t do this!
Hey!
We gotta do something!
Are you thinking, what I’m thinking?
No.
This school and these students represent the next generation of fruits.
Fruits from all different racial backgrounds and cultural identities.
Fruits that are future doctors, artists, teachers.
Fruits that are here to make this world a better place.
Let these kids have their school.
Let them learn from our mistakes in the past.
Allow them to forge a new future, free of fruitism and violence.
Let me be a martyr for this cause.
Fulfill your quest for vengeance and take my life here.
Now, on the 50 yard line of this basketball field!
Oh Charles, you’re missing the point.
It’s you who brought this on.
Because of your intelligence you’ve placed yourself on a pedestal above everyone else.
Your ignorance and self-worth have clouded your mind with bigotry and hate.
Now I’m going to teach my lesson of revenge to these impressionable young minds.
I didn’t mean to cause your electric car to crash.
Had I even remembered what happened I would have helped you out.
Oh come on, Charles, enough already.
I realize you’re trying to stall me, but nothing’s gonna stop me from firing… oooow!
Jerome?
See, while you was all talking, all you had to do was stab him with the butcher knife.
Ow!
Ow!
Jerome!
Jerome!
Oh my, what’s happening there?
Sounds awfully loud.
Ow my heart.
Why don’t I charging into the tank?
Hey!
I stabbed him to death.
Good work, Jerome.
You used everything you learned about science to defeat the enemy.
No, I didn’t.
Help me!
I’ve been stabbed 46 times.
Oh yes.
Here’s one now(?).
Oh, oh.
Ow.
Oh, oh.
Ow my vertebrae.
Ow.
Help.
Call an ambulance, please.
Actually, we kind of want you to die.
Och, Ow my back.
Oh, ow.
Oh.
Anyways.
There are really a lot of scientific principles in stabbing.
Wait.
He’s moving.
Are you still alive?
Oh, ow.
What’s this on me?
What?
What the, ow, what’s this blowing on me, och, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, look out!
My anthrax spores floated all the way here.
What is this?
Er, ow.
It’s okay.
It all landed right on Dr. Eggplant.
None of it flew anywhere near us, although we’re only standing three feet away.
It’s all right on Dr. Eggplant.
All of it.
Well, that should do it.
It’s okay.
I’ll be fine.
I’ve been taking Cipro for an unrelated infection.
Oh, I’ll get my own damn ambulance.
Oh, ow!
Hrrrrrgh.
Oh my god.
That is just nasty.
Well, that should do it.
Oh, that’s so gross.
Excuse me, I have to go.
This one’s a goner.
Tack the stem and throw her in the meat locker.
We’ll figure out who she is later.
Alright, soldiers.
Burn everything that’s not a sunflower.
Wait, wait.
Strike that, reverse it.
Ow.
Ow.
So, what seems to be the problem?
Nurse?!
So?
Do you like flowers?
Well, I guess in a roundabout way all of this is still my fault.
All of the destruction, chaos, death.
It seems to follow me whereever I go.
No, professor.
All of this was that eggplant’s fault.
Well, most of it.
But not because he was an eggplant, rather because he was a bad person.
It is wrong to judge a fruit by its color.
I’m sorry, Jerome.
It’s all good, professor.
I knew you were just a product of years of cultural ignorance, even if you didn’t.
And I apologize for assuming that all rich upper-class oranges were out for their own self-satisfaction and financial gain.
You really do care about these students and what happens to the school.
And I learned that my misconsumption of alcohol…
Yes, yes, that’s wonderful.
So Jessica, what have you learned?
I think you know what I learned, professor.
Well, since everyone’s dead I give this year’s science fair award to you.
Whatever your name is, girl, for making the machine that stopped the killer robot.
Well, thanks I guess.
But is it really right to still give out the award after everyone else died?
Come with me, yound lady.
You have a lot to learn about science fairs.
Good work.
Good work.
I knew dean Crispus wouldn’t lettuce down.
Oooh, I get it.
