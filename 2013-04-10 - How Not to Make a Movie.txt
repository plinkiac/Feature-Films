GARRETT:
And...schlock!

RICH:
What?

GARRETT:
What?

MIKE:
Gorilla Interrupted was a horrible mistake.

GARRETT:
1, 2, 3...oh!

MIKE:
It was a, a collaboration betwen four people to make a science fiction comedy film in seven days with a budget of $0.

MIKE:
I'm poking Christmas Lights through a sheet of insulation board in the attempt of making a control panel for an alien spacecraft.

MIKE:
It was a disaster. It was a nightmare. And it was an embarrassing experience for everyone involved.

JAY:
How, how do you feel about our entire stay at the, uh, the Rich Evans house?

GILCHRIST:
Sick.

RICH:
I need a doctor.

GARRETT:
This fucking huge metal chair fucking fell on my arm.

MIKE:
How you doing?

JAY:
Oh, god!

MIKE:
Oh, holy shit!

JAY:
We're screwed now!

GARRETT:
We're fucked.

MIKE:
Rich Evans was involved, uh, in, in my short films probably mid-high school.

RICH:
Ow, god! I seem to have fallen over! Augh!

RICH:
We'd could up with some crazy stupid ideas. Thing we, we never could have possibly filmed because we didn't have the resources, but then we'd go to his house after school and we'd try anyway.

MIKE:
I put Rich in costumes in my parents' basement and threw things at him. And, uh, make him embarrass himself for my own amusement.

RICH:
It's Gay Fireman, dad! I'm gonna hose you down! You never supported me in my career choice to be a gay fireman! Ooh, oh!

MIKE:
We made a lot of short films, uh, mostly after school in my parents' basement. Um, uh, the most famous of which is Richard Edlund vs. His Sons.

COSMONAUT:
They're coming! You must get a weapon! Go!

RICH:
Richard Edlund was some kind of weird British television personality, and just, just the most bizarre things would happen on his shows. Like, his, his children, his illegitimate children would team up to try and killl him.

RICH:
I'm one of your sons! Russie-Tolda-Volgatron! With a hat and vacuum accessories!

RICH
I'm gonna bludgeon you with my Volgar arms!

RICH:
I am Breakfast Man! Aughh!

RICH:
That was a movie. That was the whole movie we made.

MIKE:
Another film me and Rich made, uh, we had an idea to create a character called Battle-Man, aftter, uh, watching a documentary about a man who invented a bear suit, which was a, um, a indestructible suit that this man made that he could fight bears with. And me and Rich were so fascinated by this, we, we thought of an idea of Battle-Man, a man who has an indestructible suit of armor.

RICH:
Battle-Man was bascically just an excuse to build a full-armor costume. We were, we were going for something like, like Iron-Man. And what we ended up with was toys spray-painted grey.

RICH:
Oh!

MIKE:
Rich Evans wore the Battle-Man suit and fought Satan in, in his grandmother's backyard.

RICH:
My, my nickname for the, the Battle-Man costume was the Mobility Limiter 3000, because you couldn't move in this costume.

MIKE:
This is the stuff I did in my high school years. So, me and Rich Evans were making movies, and, um, we, we kind of became part of an online website community of low-budget filmmakers. And that's where, um, I met Jay.

JAY:
This was around 1999. I was, uh, uh, frequenting a message board on a website that was devoted to amateur film, uh, and amateur filmmakers. And this was back in the day before YouTube, really. Before internet videos, people were literally sending each other VHS tapes back and forth. Uh, and so I had met Mike on this message board.

RICH:
First time I ever really heard of Jay Bauman was, I watched his film Disconnected.

JAY:
Independent film is just too sophisticated for you.

LISA:
What does not being able to breed have to do with anything?

RICH:
I can't say this about any other amateur movie: I actually wanted to watch it a second time, which is unheard of with no-budget schlock. So it was really good.

JAY:
At that time, I was mainly making sort of vulgar comedies. Really, sort of, uh, inspired by John Waters and, uh, a little bit of Kevin Smith, and things like that. So, uh, really sort of character-driven, moreso than plot-driven, uh, to a detriment.

MIKE:
I soon discovered we had similar, uh, tastes in humor. We had made similar kind of comedy films, and we both had, uh, the same, um, we took what we were doing a lot less seriously than everyone else on the website.

JAY:
The level of filmmaking we were all at at that point was, you know, they were amateur movies. That's what this, uh, message board was devoted to. But there was people involved with that community that were making, you know, Pulp Fiction knockoffs. Uh, 20-year olds in a dorm room pretending to be hitman, but they're wearing shorts, and there's Bob Marley's posters behind them, and things like that. And, uh, Mike and Rich were sort of, uh, celebrating the fact they were making no-budget garbage, as opposed to pretending it was something that it wasn't.

LISA:
I met Jay Bauman in high school. And I remember going over to Jay's house, and he had, like, VHS tapes that Mike had sent him, and we watched, like, two hours worth of some of his earlier stuff. And I remember thinking...that some of it was a little weird. And I don't remember specifics, but I do remember there was one feature film that had this creepy, creepy doll. And it was kind of like a Chucky Doll.

MUSHU:
Hello, there!

NANNOO:
Is that a talking, uh, space baby, uh, Willy, what is that?

MUSHU:
A space baby? What?

LISA:
And throughout the whole movie, the doll was just being, like, beaten up repeatedly, and just, like, violated...

MUSHU:
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Oh! Ugh! Oh, no! Oh! Ow, god! Someone call an ambulance!

LISA:
And, uh, the film, I think, ended with a freeze frame of the doll being thrown into the air.

RICH:
Did you hear that, Mushu? Did you? We're free!

MIKE:
Jay's films were very odd and quirky and had a lot of eccentric characters. And the stuff I was making with Rich was more vulgar, dumb, blunt stupidity.

MIKE:
Ow, my groin!

JAY:
I was about 70 miles north of him. They were, him and Rich were in Chicago area, and I was up in Milwaukee, uh, so we started talking about possibly collaborating on stuff. So I asked Mike if him and Rich wanted to come up and be in a movie I was making called The Trouble with Her Uterus.

RICH:
I actually first met Jay at the, uh, Burger Barn in Rockford, Illinois.

JAY:
My name is Jay Bauman!

LISA:
Lisa Renley.

RICH:
And that's when we filmed The Trouble with Her Uterus.

MIKE:
I played a character named Big K. Uh, uh, uh, a K-Mart employee who thought of himself as a gangster.

MIKE:
You know I get an employee discount at the K Cafe. What do you say you and me go and get some super pretzels?

GIRL:
Sure!

MIKE:
And Rich Evans played, uh, uh, an adult baby.

RICH:
It wasn't really an adult baby. I think it was supposed to be an actual baby played by an adult Rich Evans.

RICH:
Oh, aughh!

RICH:
That is probably the single most humiliating moment in my life.

MIKE:
Uh, we collaborated on a number of projects. And Gorilla Interrupted ended up becoming a, a feature film collaboration.

JAY:
Mike didn't do a lot of features, and the ones he did were...bad. So, he, the, the, the, Mike and Rich shined at doing these bizarre short films. They were making these really entertaining shorts, and they didn't do a lot of features. And, uh, this was sort of an attempt to...I don't know if it was intentional on Mike's part, but it was kind of taking, uh, elements that were in the movies I was making and then the schlocky elements from their bizarro short films, and kind of trying to make something that fit both of those styles.

MIKE:
Jay, Jay joined as, uh, as one of the actors, and one of the creative team that made it. And same with another filmmaker named, uh, Garrett Gilchron.

JAY:
We bonded with Garrett, uh, for the same reason that, that I bonded with Mike and Rich, was that he was also a part of that community, and he also did not take anyone else there seriously, or respect anyone on that message board.

MIKE:
Jay lived in Milwaukee. Me and Rich lived down in Illinois, in Chicago. And Garrett, I think, was in California at the time. The idea was made for all of us to get together for a week and shoot a film. I wrote a one-paragraph treatment, and I think that's what I kind of presented to Garrett and Jay and Rich, and I said, "Let's film this. It's got four characters in it. Um, we can do sort of a sci-fi comedy thing. It'll be schlock. It'll be fun. And we can do it in a week." And the treatment I wrote basically said, uh, "Rich turns into a monkey," uh, "Someone," uh, uh, "Someone's a punk rocker," and then I think at the end, I said, "Jay," and "Jay Bauman plays somebody." So, even though that's a major component of the film, it was something that was not even in there.

RICH:
Basically, Gorilla Interrupted was just an excuse to collaborate. And, uh, when I saw the script, well, first of all, the script was, like, written in a day.

MIKE:
I wrote the script, I think, in a day. Uh, and it was 40 or 50 pages, leaving room for, um, improv and, uh, elaboration and stuff, so, uh...very loose script. We were just gonna wing it. Most of it. Uh, the script was really just an outline.

LISA:
So the thing about getting a script from Jay or Mike is that, on paper, it's not always necessarily extremely funny. Like, you can have a scene where it's, like, Rich Evans falls down. But, when it's actually executed, and when they edit it together, Rich Evans falling down is, like, the best thing in the world because he's just so good at it. And they just edit it together so well that it's just extremely funny. But I'm sure when I got the Gorilla Interrupted script, I was, like, "Yeah, this is good..." But, in reality, I'm sure it was.

RICH:
Before, before we made the movie, it was just, like, talk: "Yeah, we're gonna make something. Let's make a movie. All right. It'll be fun. We'll make a movie." And then, one day, before, uh, everyone flew into Chicago, that's, that's the first time I saw the script. So the script was written overnight. And my expectations were, uh, this is gonna be impossible.

JAY:
I didn't think it was that bizarre to try and shoot a movie like that, that quickly, because I was making movies in a similar style at that point. I, I was sort of just slapping movies together, more for the sake of having a movie than to take time and craft a scene and do all these things. I was just trying to slap together dumb comedy. So, it, it didn't strike me at first how, uh, sort of unrealistic it was to try and make Gorilla in that short amount of time. Uh, it, it, it dawned on me very quickly into the shooting that it was a bad idea, though.

MIKE:
The script was ambitious. Uh, and I think back then, the decision was made to shoot it in a week, one, because, um, travel issues, was that all of were from three different states, and, um, we couldn't really, u, especially Garrett, who had to fly out there. Uh, we had a limited amount of time with him, and we wanted to collaborate with him, so we didn't have a lot of time, just for logistical reasons. And, two, the second reason of shooting an ambitious script in seven days is naivete, and being completely stupid. At the same time, I think the project was more kind of just for fun. We weren't trying to make a feature film that we could sell to a distributor or do anything with. It was really just kind of a fun, um, collaboration. And, and we, we all enjoyed doing improv and, um, physical comedy, and, you know, we wanted, uh, uh, to have Rich to have his scene where he did his boobery, and knock things over and broke stuff. And Garrett wanted to do his, uh, whacky, um, uh, safari character.

RICH:
We're, we're trying to film a feature-length movie, and we have less than a week to do it. I, I just thought it was going to be a complete disaster, and time eventually proved me right.

JAY:
Well, the first day of shooting was also the first day of pre-production, which I think is how most movies are made.

JAY:
I'm kind of scared, and sad, and happy all at once.

JAY:
Mike actually came up to Milwaukee and picked me up because I didn't have a car at that point, and drove me down, and before anything else, we stopped at his parents' place. I don't remember why, but we stopped there, and immediately when I walked down to the basement, my eye just swelled shut.

JAY:
And the first thing that happens when we get here is, we go to Mr. Mike Stoklasa's house, and my eye swells up. Not, not a good, uh, not a good sign.

JAY:
I had an allergic reaction to something. And I think that was an omen of things to come.

MIKE:
The first day, I think the first thing we did was we drove around and looked for props, and I think that's where we came up with the title?

JAY:
We were all just throwing out dumb ideas, and I, I said, "We should call the movie 'Girl, Interrupted: Part 2." And I thought that was funny. And somebody -- I don't know if it was Mike or Rich -- one of the two, I think, mis-, uh, uh, misheard me, and  thought I said, "Gorilla Interrupted." And, so we said, "Let's call it that."

MIKE:
I had written the script with the intention of it being short. It was about, um, 50 pages long, or something like. And, uh, I allowed a lot of room for improv. And, um, I told Garrett that, uh, this was essentially my movie. A GMP Production movie. Um, and, and Jay understood that. It was sort of, like, um, he was, we were all collaborating together, but someone needed to be in charge of the movie. It couldn't just be a complete free-for-all.

JAY:
I, I didn't have any involvement at all with the concept of the movie or the writing of the movie. It was just, uh, I think, Mike saying, "I'm gonna write this movie, and we'll make it in a week." And I said, "Okay. Just tell me what to do." Uh, it wasn't my movie. Uh, and I was going to, uh, make no attempt to commandeer the movie, because I understood it wasn't mine. Uh, I...

GARRETT:
What. The. Fuck. I got in. They locked me in the plane for 40 minutes.

MIKE:
Sir, I don't know who you are.

JAY:
Why are you running up to us?

GARRETT:
I'm gonna kill you.

RICH:
Well, this is gonna be an exciting week!

GARRETT:
Hello, Rich!

RICH:
Howdy, Garrett.

RICH:
We went to pick Garrett up at the airport and, uh, Garrett pulls this script out of his bag.

MIKE:
He came with, uh, a completely rewritten script, which was about twice as long as the original version, with pages and pages and pages of extemperaneous, pointless dialogue added to scenes, when we had a very tight shooting schedule. He wrote all these lines of dialogue that were just physically impossible to shoot in the time constraints we had.

RICH:
I, I don't know why. I think he just thought it was...I don't know what he thought. Nobody knows what Garrett thought.

JAY:
We shot the movie on my camcorder. It was a MiniDV camcorder. I think it was a Sharp. I think that was the brand. I don't know why we shot in on my camera. It was the worst camcorder. It, it was terrible in, not just in low light, but in normal light, it was grainy. And there was no proper jack to plug in a microphone. So the entire movie was shot the onboard mic, which is why almost every scene is, like, awkward weird close-ups, or everybody shouting. We were at least aware that you needed to get clean audio, even if we ddin't have the proper capabilities to do so.

MIKE:
Oh, and we bought, uh, uh, a shop light from Home Depot to do our, uh, lighting. The first scene that we filmed was the, uh, the scene with Ray and, uh, Jacob, uh, Ray is interrogating Jacob, and he's tied to a chair. And, uh, we started filming, and there was dialogue that I was completely unaware of, as the director of the project.

GARRETT:
Come back here! Walk away...I can't say, "Come back here," if you don't walk away.

JAY:
He's wearing a Santa Claus hat for no reason. I don't know why that ended up in it. And, and then he told Rich to pour soda on his head.

GARRETT:
You're a foul beast of evil...YOU'RE A FOUL BEAST OF EVIL!

JAY:
And I noticed Mike at that point completely shut down.

GARRETT:
What are you trying to accomplish with this movie?

MIKE:
Well, I'm trying to get you killed in an accident on the set.

JAY:
I, I think he sort of lost, uh, lost his mind a bit about the fact that he had no control over his own movie anymore.

MIKE:
And I was trying to direct a scene that, uh, I did not know what it was. So that was not a good start to a film.

JAY:
It definitely put everybody in sort of an awkward mood. Uh, Rich is, you know, he's more of an actor, so he'll kind of go along with whoever's giving him direction. Uh, I didn't know what to make of it. I didn't know what to do, because I didn't feel it was my place to try and take over the movie. Uh, so I, I noticed Mike being very quiet. And I didn't know how we were going to get around that. So I think we just kind of stopped shooting for a while, and, and try to regroup and sort of, uh, get everybody's mind back on track.

MIKE:
I think at some point, I came back to my senses, and we continued shooting the film. But I was very annoyed at that first day. And I kind of told Garrett, uh, we're not shooting any, any of this stupid crap. We're shooting other stupid crap.

GARRETT:
Oh, shit.

JAY:
Oh, we've had our first injury.

GARRETT:
I just split my lip right open. Oh, and if we're documenting injuries, Mr. Mike Stoklasa's, uh, has a, he has a broken heart.

MIKE:
So after we came to, uh, an understanding of all of our disagreements, and all the hatred kind of subsided momentarily, we, we shot our next scene, which was all four characters yelling at each other in the kitchen.

RICH:
Eat shit! Go fuck yourself!

MIKE:
Go to hell, you cocksucker!

RiCH:
Eat shit. This is all just a practical joke.

GARRETT:
Eat shit.

JAY:
I like when you said it like that. "Eat shit. You're a cocksucking asshole. Fuck you."

MIKE:
That's when the movie picked up.

RICH:
It was just kind of magical, that scene. I, I, I'm not sure why, but that scene energized everybody.

MIKE:
I think it was late, later at night, and, um, and we were just sort of, like, getting a little loopy, and, and we filmed the scene where we're all screaming and shouting.

MIKE:
I wanna see you transform into a monkey!

RICH:
I'm not a goddamn monkey, you son of a bitch!

JAY:
And everybody was in a good mood after that because we were, uh, getting into the characters and sort of understanding their dynamics in a way that was hard to figure out with that first scene, which was just two of the characters.

RICH:
Everybody there was just kind of firing on all cylinders. The, the characters came into place. The dialogue was working. And the movie finally got off the ground, only to come to a screeching halt once I got everybody sick.

MIKE:
A sickness spread amongst everyone. Not just a, a, a sickness of the mind. A sickness of the body, as well. It can be traced back to Rich Evans's girlfriend, who gave him a cold at some point. And then, um, everyone stayed at Rich Evans's grandma's house. I think, I think the story goes, it was Rich and Garrett had stayed in Rich Evans's room, and were just chatting all night. And Rich Evans's had absolutely no ventilation. And I think it, Rich gave Garrett a cold, and it just spread from there.

RICH:
I remember at one point, Garrett was throwing up in my kitchen sink. I had a bathroom, of course. He could have gone into the bathroom and thrown up into the toilet, but instead he chose to throw up in the kitchen sink, where I keep my dishes.

GARRETT:
He, like me, um, has just lost his voice due to the satanic cold given to us by Mr. Rich Evans's clone. Um...

RICH:
No problem!

GARRETT:
Can I just say at this point, "Ow, my voice!"

MIKE:
"Ow, my groin!"

GARRETT:
There go the upper registers of our voices. We can only sort of speak in these disgusting monotones. Ow, my voice!

JAY:
That's why there's so much yelling in the movie. You, I mean, there's supposed to be a lot of yelling, anyway, because the characters are always angry at each other, but there's so many scenes where the lines were being delivered in just this constant yell, because otherwise they couldn't speak.

MIKE:
Let me see these. I don't know if I'm seeing reality. Cut.

MIKE:
We were shooting blue screen stuff for Hell, and I think all of us had lost our voices at that point. I certainly did. I remember my voice was just gone.

RICH:
That was probably where everybody was the most miserable.

MIKE:
You call that an argument, you women? You call that an argument, you old ladies? I can argue! Cut.

GARRETT:
Uh, we're here on the set with George Lucas for the taping of Episode II: Ow, My Clones.

MIKE:
Mr. Lucas, I don't know if I can perform against a blue screen constantly. I need other actors doing...oh, oh, you punched me in the fucking face

GARRETT:
Fuck you!

JAY:
The most frustrating scene for me to shoot was the Hell stuff, because there's this whole scene where I'm off by myself, and the other three characters are all supposed to start arguing, and it's supposed to escalate, and that's what leads to Ray turning into the Gorilla again. And that was a case of, there was no dialogue in the script. It was just, "And they argue." So, there was no, uh, uh, focus as far as, "How do we get to that point?"

JAY:
Action.

RICH:
Nobody ever hits me like that, Jacob.

GARRETT:
Well, I did. Did I do good?

RICH:
Oh, you did just fine. I think maybe I should hit you back.

GARRETT:
Why?

RICH:
Because it'll hurt. A lot.

GARRETT:
Yes. Yes, it will.

RICH:
What do you want, Sid?

MIKE:
It's too long.

JAY:
Just, we just kind of were rolling, and seeing where it went. And Garrett didn't want to argue, or he couldn't argue, or something.

GARRETT:
If you hit me, it, it...I'm obviously saying something. Dont...stog.

RICH:
You look like a fucking lawn.

MIKE:
No, it...

RICH:
That was the lamest insult I ever heard.

GARRETT:
Hey, I won my...

RICH:
The only thing you ever won was a fucked-fest.

JAY:
I was manning the camera at that point, and I'm watching, and it was just so frustrating because I kind of knew where the scene needed to go, but nobody was on the same page, as far as how to get it to that point. So it was like everybody was in their own little world.

MIKE:
Why don't you go drink out of your sauce bottle? Were you boozing it up before you met the fucking devil?

GARRETT:
You've already done that one.

RICH:
What the fuck are you...vap-...fuck.

MIKE:
Cut.

RICH:
Everybody was sick. Everybody had spent the last 72 hours working on a movie, and, uh, at the end of those three days, we still had about 70% of the movie left to go. So everybody was miserable.

MIKE:
How much do you wanna die?

GARRETT:
Not much.

MIKE:
Okay.

RICH:
That's a good sign.

MIKE:
The shoot is, like, good, bad, good, bad, good, it was just an up-and-down kind of thing.

RICH:
We were just terrible. We were miserable. We were sad. We were depressed. We were hungry. We were overworked. But every now and then, there was this bizarre, creative energy that just, it, it came through all of that.

JAY:
There was sort of, like, this weird kind of, like, like, like, fever dream quality. Like, everybody was just slap-happy and delirious the entire time we were making the movie. And I think that added to it.

RICH:
The end of that, that, that three days of Chicago shooting, the, the house was just completely trashed.

RICH:
I'm gonna start cleaning the house, but I have no energy.

MIKE:
We shot a lot of the movie in Rich Evans's house, which really was nobody's house at the time. It used to be Nannoo's house. Nannoo is, of course, Rich Evans's grandmother.

NANNOO:
What is that thing?

RICH:
We'd filmed a lot of movies there before. Uh, we were just able to get away with a lot of stuff there. It's, like, my grandmother just did not care.

MUSHU:
Aughh!

RICH:
By the time we got around to, uh, Gorilla, uh, my grandmother had actually passed on by that point.

MIKE:
At the time, Rich's uncle was trying to restore the house, to try and sell it. Um, uh, so we just destroyed it because we could. And it was a place to film the movie.

RICH:
We didn't even have to bring in new things to destroy. We just could destroy the things that were already there because we were trying to get rid of it anyway.

JAY:
Our mass destruction of this house continues.

RICH:
Here we were, some 20-year old kids, uh, with 7 days on our hands. A house full of objects and things to destroy. I mean, it was, it was kind of crazy.

MIKE:
Action!

JAY:
Well, I was living in the Nannoo house while we were shooting in Chicago. Garrett and I were sleeping on the floor. I think we had an air mattress. I think we were sleeping on that. Maybe there was two. Or maybe we shared one. I don't remember. I hope we didn't share one.

RICH:
It was like a three-day commune. They were out sleeping in the living room. I was out sleeping in the back. And then we'd, we'd sleep, then we'd film, then we'd go to sleep. It was, like, all we did for three days.

GARRETT:
If you destroy...ow!

GARRETT:
My nose...

JAY:
Let me zoom in on the nose.

GARRETT:
Ugh...

JAY:
Got a scar on the nose.

GARRETT:
Two scars.

JAY:
Two scars. And plenty more all over.

GARRETT:
Oh, fuck. Look at that bruise.

JAY:
And now we're gonna head up to Milwaukee, which is a much happier and better place.

GARRETT:
Is it?

JAY:
Yes.

GARRETT:
Okay. When will the hurting stop?

RICH:
We didn't have time to clean it up, so we, we just left the house as it was, and went up to Milwaukee. And then, uh, apparently when we were up in Milwaukee, my uncle showed up for a visit at the house, and he, he went in and saw all that destruction.

RECORDING:
Message. One.

DINK:
Yeah, it's me, Dink. I was out there today. I plugged in the answering machine. And, uh, we've got to talk about that house. It's a wreck. I, I don't know, you're away. I don't know what's going on. I don't know how to reach you. What if the realtors call and want to show the house? I don't know what happened. The switch to the, over the front door is just busted. The register coming in is all smashed in. I just replaced that register. Ya know? Uh, I left the vacuum because the fact is the house, it looks awful. And there's garbage all over the back porch. Animals got in it. The place stinks.

RECORDING:
3:02 a.m.

JAY:
Here's the carnage here now. Moved up from Chicago to Milwaukee.

RICH:
When we moved up to Milwaukee, everything got worse.

MIKE:
We were all in a deep, deep depression.

GARRETT:
What do you, what do you think about Milwaukee? There's been far less accidents, far less injuries, and a lot more depression.

JAY:
And far less enthusiasm.

GARRETT:
Far less enthusiasm. It was, like, the minute we came here to Milwaukee, basically everybody stopped caring.

MIKE:
Before today, it was worse than Chicago. I felt physically iller, more tired. I had less of a cold, but I just didn't care. The grey, glooming clouds and cold weather and, I think we all needed a break, but we just couldn't take one.

JAY:
We didn't have time.

MIKE:
Right. Exactly. And that, and that looming, uh, fear that we couldn't take a break at all just set in obscene amounts of depression on everybody.

MIKE:
I, I, I think Rich Evans had said it, like, he's like, "I wish we just all hung out this week, and just had fun, um, because this is a miserable nightmare." So, it got bad. I think Jay started to hate us.

RICH:
We stayed at Jay's place, and Jay was living in an apartment with 18 other men.

JAY:
It was my first apartment. I was just, like, a 20-whatever, 21-year old. And a really dumpy attic apartment. I had two roommates, and everybody else -- Rich, Garrett, and Mike -- slept in my living room. I'm, I'm sure at least one of them slept on that couch, which, you see it in the movie. It's the couch in the movie. And it's disgusting. And I'm, I'm guessing somebody slept on it. 

MIKE:
Get the fuck out of my house!

MIKE:
We al l stayed in Jay's apartment, and slept on his floor. We had stayed up to, like, three in the morning, and we were all talking and laughing. And Jay had to work at, like, 6 a.m. or something. And he came out and he yelled at us. I said, "Fuck you guys, and fuck your movie, I have to go to work."

MIKE:
An asshole.

MIKE:
Fuck.

RICH:
Oh, my god! Aughh! Oh, my god, there's broken glass!

MIKE:
There was a scene where Rich falls down a hill, and rolls through branches and stuff. I, I don't remember where that came from.

RICH:
I, I, I know it was a reference to one of Jay's older movies we filmed, uh, Pervert Goes Home.

RICH:
Oh, my god, the branches! The branches, they hurt! Ow!

RICH:
The honest truth is, I don't even remember a lot of that, the actual filming. At that point, everything was just kind of like a mind-numbing slog. At that point, we were just trying to get through the movie, somehow. Because it seemed, it seemed impossible. I didn't think we were even going to get the movie done.

MIKE:
It was funny. It was funny to watch him roll down a hill. It was funny because I didn't have to do it.

RICH:
I rolled down a hill 28 times yesterday.

JAY:
Barefoot, too, right?

RICH:
Bare-, walked around the forest filled with broken glass. Barefeet. And I rolled down a hill 28 times.

RICH:
Oww-w-w-w!!

JAY:
I was really optimistic about things at that time because I was also making movies that were horribly slapped together. And I kind of viewed them at the time as, "Yeah, they're horribly slapped together, but they're funny!" Or whatever. Even when everybody was miserable and didn't want to make the movie anymore, I think that thought was still in my brain that, you know, maybe this could work. We just can't see it because we're clouded by, like, illness and depression at the time.

JAY:
Do you even know your character's name?

LISA:
Julie! It's Julie.

JAY:
Oh, okay, she does.

MIKE:
"Do you know your character's name?"

MIKE:
Uh, Lisa came up and filmed all of her scenes.

JAY:
So we, uh, we shot all the blue screen stuff with Lisa. And then we took down the blue screen. And then, uh, someone wise'd up and remembered that we didn't get all the blue screen stuff..

GARRETT:
This is the most retarted thing.

MIKE:
Perfect.

LISA:
I remember getting there, and was it, I think I was only there for a day or two, but everybody was just in, like a foul mood. And they were sick. And it just smelled. And it was awful. No one wanted to make that movie.

MIKE:
You know what's the great irony about all of this?

JAY:
What?

MIKE:
It's like we have all these war stories, and all this, like, horror filmmaking, and it would be great if we were making, like, a quality film that we could...but in the end, it's, it's just gonna be crap that we churn out. It's kind of like a plagued protection on Police Academy: Part 7.

JAY:
That's it. They're about to leave. Last, last words?

GARRETT:
Um, go fuck yourself.

RICH:
Yeah, go fuck yourself!

LISA:
I don't have anything.

RICH:
What else to say about Milwaukee? I was glad to leave.

JAY:
Okay, bye all.

MIKE:
Bye.

JAY:
Garrett.

GARRETT:
Oh, I loved working on this movie. It was the nicest movie shoot of my life. Oh, god. I'm dead.

JAY:
Bye, guys!

MIKE:
Someone drag his corpse to the car. And I'll ship it back to L.A. in a box.

MIKE:
I was not excited to start editing this movie. Um, and I don't even know why I bothered to do it. Um, I, I, I did not like how the production went.

MIKE:
Go fuck yourself! Go fuck yourself, you asshole!

MIKE:
We filmed all the stuff with the main actors first, and when everybody went back to their normal lives, I still had shots of aliens to gets.

RICH:
At that point, the movie seemed like it was going to be a horrible failure, so we slkapped that shit together as cheaply and quickly as possible.

MIKE:
Action.

MIKE:
I, I filmed the components for the alien stuff without caring at all. Even less, which I think goes into the negative of caring.

MIKE:
Okay, four men beam aboard your spacecraft, directly ahead.

MIKE:
I put Rich Evans sitting on a chair in his grandmother's living room. I think the set was, uh, a little end table with a computer monitor on it. And Rich had asked, "Should I change out of my sweat pants and my socks?" And I said, "No." And there were other scenes where, um, the alien was talking, and I think I just panned away, because I was done filming.

MIKE:
Aim the blasters at the city, and blow the fuck out of the city!

RICH:
Yeah, yeah. No effort was taken at all, and strangely those are the best scenes in the movie.
